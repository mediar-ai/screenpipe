[Cline](https://github.com/cline/cline) is an autonomous AI coding agent for VS Code with 30k+ GitHub stars. it supports MCP servers, so you can connect screenpipe to give Cline context about what you've been working on across all your apps.

## setup

1. open VS Code with Cline installed
2. open Cline settings (gear icon in Cline panel)
3. go to **MCP Servers**
4. add screenpipe:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

5. click the refresh icon to reload MCP servers

## usage

once configured, Cline can search your screen history while coding:

```
> I was reading documentation about async/await patterns earlier,
> find it and help me apply those patterns here

> what error messages have I seen in my terminal today?

> find the API response format I was looking at in the browser
```

## plan mode with context

Cline's "Plan" mode works great with screenpipe:

1. switch to Plan mode
2. ask Cline to find relevant context from your screen history
3. let it create a plan based on what you've been working on
4. switch to Act mode to execute

```
> [Plan mode] I was researching authentication patterns earlier,
> find what I was looking at and plan how to implement it here
```

## available tools

screenpipe provides:

- **search-content** - search screen OCR, audio transcriptions
- **search-ui-events** - search accessibility data: keyboard input, mouse clicks, app switches, clipboard (macOS)
- **get-ui-event-stats** - get aggregated app usage statistics

## requirements

- screenpipe running on localhost:3030
- VS Code with Cline extension
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
