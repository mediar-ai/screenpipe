screenpipe uses Apple's on-device Foundation Models to analyze your recorded activity — no data leaves your Mac. requires macOS 26+ with Apple Intelligence enabled on Apple Silicon.

## daily summaries

screenpipe automatically generates a summary of your day at **6 PM** (when plugged in). the summary appears in your **timeline** view and includes:

- **one-liner** — casual summary of your day
- **key moments** — up to 5 important events from audio transcriptions
- **action items** — things mentioned in conversations, ranked by urgency
- **people mentioned** — names and context from your conversations

you can also click the Apple Intelligence icon in the timeline to generate a summary manually at any time.

### how it works

1. fetches your audio transcriptions for the day
2. sends them to Apple's on-device Foundation Models (never leaves your Mac)
3. returns a structured summary with key moments, action items, and people
4. caches the result locally so it loads instantly next time

### enable/disable

open **settings** → **connections** → toggle **Apple Intelligence** on or off.

## auto reminders

screenpipe can scan your activity every 30 minutes and automatically create action items in **Apple Reminders**.

### setup

1. open **settings** → **connections** → find the **Apple Intelligence** card
2. click **"Connect Apple Reminders"** (grants Reminders permission)
3. toggle on **auto-scanning**

once enabled, screenpipe will:
- scan your screen & audio every 30 minutes
- extract action items using Apple Intelligence
- create reminders in a **"Screenpipe"** list in Apple Reminders
- auto-deduplicate so you don't get repeat reminders

### options

- **audio only** — skip screen data, only analyze audio transcriptions (on by default)
- **custom prompt** — add instructions like "focus on coding tasks" or "ignore social media"
- **scan now** — manually trigger a scan anytime

## requirements

- **macOS 26+** (Tahoe) with Apple Intelligence enabled
- **Apple Silicon** (M1 or later)
- screenpipe running on localhost:3030

<Note>
if Apple Intelligence shows as "not available", check that it's enabled in **System Settings → Apple Intelligence & Siri** and that your Mac meets the requirements.
