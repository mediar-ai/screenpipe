screenpipe records your screen 24/7 and lets you search through everything. find that code snippet, conversation, or document you saw last week.

## how it works

1. **continuous capture** — screenpipe records your screen at configurable intervals (default: 1 frame/second)
2. **OCR extraction** — text is extracted from every frame using native OCR engines
3. **local storage** — everything stored in a local SQLite database
4. **search API** — query via `localhost:3030/search` with filters

## search examples

### find by text

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=project+apollo+budget&content_type=ocr&limit=20"
```

### find by app

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?app_name=Code&content_type=ocr&limit=20"
```

### find by time range

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=standup&start_time=2026-02-10T14:00:00Z&end_time=2026-02-10T18:00:00Z"
```

### find by browser URL

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?browser_url=github.com&limit=10"
```

### combine filters

```bash
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=deployment&app_name=Slack&content_type=ocr&limit=10"
```

## using the desktop app

the easiest way to search is the built-in search in the screenpipe desktop app:

2. use the search bar or timeline view
3. scroll through your day visually
4. select content to chat with AI about it

## search tips

- **be specific**: "slack message from john about deployment" > "deployment"
- **use time context**: combine `start_time` and `end_time` for precision
- **combine filters**: app name + time range + keywords

## privacy

- all search happens locally on your device
- no data leaves your machine
- control what's recorded with `--ignored-windows` and `--included-windows`
