screenpipe acts as a memory layer for AI — it gives LLMs context about what you've been doing on your computer.

## why AI needs memory

LLMs are stateless — they don't know what you were working on 5 minutes ago. screenpipe bridges this by:

- capturing everything on your screen 24/7
- extracting text via OCR
- making it searchable via REST API on `localhost:3030`

## connect to AI

### MCP (recommended)

screenpipe has a built-in MCP server that works with Claude Desktop, Cursor, and other MCP-compatible tools:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "screenpipe-mcp",
      "args": []
    }
  }
}
```

see [MCP server setup](/mcp-server) for details.

### pipes (scheduled agents)

[pipes](/pipes) are AI agents that run on a schedule and act on your screen data automatically — like syncing to Obsidian, tracking time in Toggl, or sending daily summaries.

### direct API

any tool that can make HTTP requests can query screenpipe:

```bash
# get recent screen activity
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=ocr&limit=20"

# search for specific content
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=meeting+notes&app_name=Slack&limit=10"
```

## use cases

| use case | how |
|----------|-----|
| "what was I working on?" | search by time range |
| "summarize today's meetings" | query audio transcriptions |
| "find that code snippet" | search OCR text |
| "auto-track my time" | toggl-sync pipe |
| "sync activity to notes" | obsidian-sync pipe |

## privacy-first

- all data stays on your device
- use local LLMs (Ollama, LMStudio) for complete privacy
- filter what gets captured with `--ignored-windows` and `--included-windows`
- no data sent to cloud unless you explicitly choose cloud providers

## next steps

- [set up MCP server](/mcp-server) — connect to Claude, Cursor
- [set up pipes](/pipes) — scheduled AI agents
- [CLI reference](/cli-reference) — search parameters and API endpoints
