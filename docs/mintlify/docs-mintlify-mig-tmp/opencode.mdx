[OpenCode](https://github.com/opencode-ai/opencode) is a powerful terminal-based AI coding assistant written in Go. it implements the [Agent Skills](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) open standard, which means screenpipe skills work out of the box.

## setup

OpenCode discovers skills from multiple locations. copy the screenpipe skills to any of these:

### option 1: project-level

```bash
# copy to current project
mkdir -p .opencode/skills
cp -r /path/to/screenpipe/.claude/agents/* .opencode/skills/
```

### option 2: user-level (global)

```bash
# copy to home directory for all projects
mkdir -p ~/.opencode/skills
cp -r /path/to/screenpipe/.claude/agents/* ~/.opencode/skills/
```

### option 3: clone directly

```bash
# clone screenpipe and symlink skills
git clone https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe ~/screenpipe
ln -s ~/screenpipe/.claude/agents ~/.opencode/skills/screenpipe
```

<Note>
OpenCode uses the same Agent Skills format as Claude Code. files in `.claude/agents/` work in `.opencode/skills/` and vice versa.
</Note>

## available skills

| skill | description |
|-------|-------------|
| `screenpipe-query` | search screen OCR, audio transcriptions, and UI events (keyboard input, clicks, app switches, clipboard) |
| `screenpipe-health` | check status, diagnose issues, verify permissions |
| `screenpipe-logs` | retrieve and analyze screenpipe logs |

## usage

OpenCode automatically discovers installed skills. invoke them in your prompts:

```bash
# start OpenCode
opencode

> @screenpipe-query find what I was reading about docker compose

> @screenpipe-health check if recording is working

> @screenpipe-logs show me errors from today
```

or let OpenCode choose automatically:

```bash
> what was I working on in VS Code this morning?
# OpenCode will invoke screenpipe-query

> is my screen recording working?
# OpenCode will invoke screenpipe-health
```

## MCP alternative

OpenCode also supports MCP servers. if you prefer MCP over skills:

```bash
# add to your opencode config
opencode config mcp add screenpipe "npx -y screenpipe-mcp"
```

<Tip>
skills are more token-efficient than MCP. the OpenCode team recommends skills for most use cases, with MCP for external API integrations.
</Tip>

## example workflows

**context-aware coding:**
```
> I was looking at a react component earlier that had a cool
> animation effect, use screenpipe to find it and help me
> implement something similar
```

**recall documentation:**
```
> use screenpipe to find that kubernetes docs page I was
> reading about pod scheduling
```

**meeting follow-up:**
```
> what did we discuss in the team call about the database
> migration? use screenpipe to find it
```

**debug from memory:**
```
> there was an error in my terminal earlier, use screenpipe
> to find it and help me fix it
```

## skill format reference

screenpipe skills follow the Agent Skills standard:

```markdown
---
name: screenpipe-query
description: Query screen recordings and audio transcriptions
tools:
  - Bash
  - WebFetch
---

# Screenpipe Query Agent

Instructions for querying screenpipe data...
```

you can customize these skills or create your own following the same format.

## requirements

- screenpipe running on localhost:3030
- OpenCode installed (`go install github.com/opencode-ai/opencode@latest`)
- skills copied to `.opencode/skills/` or `~/.opencode/skills/`

## troubleshooting

**skills not discovered?**
- run `opencode skills list` to see available skills
- verify files are in correct location with valid yaml frontmatter
- check skill file ends in `.md`

**queries returning no data?**
- verify screenpipe is running: `curl http://localhost:3030/health`
- check data exists: `curl "http://localhost:3030/search?limit=1"`
- ensure screenpipe has screen recording permissions

**OpenCode not using skills?**
- mention the skill explicitly: `@screenpipe-query find...`
- check skill description matches your query intent
