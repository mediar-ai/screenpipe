## what are pipes?

pipes are automated workflows that run on your screenpipe data at regular intervals. each pipe is a markdown file with a prompt and a schedule. under the hood, screenpipe runs a coding agent (like [pi](https://github.com/mariozechner/pi-coding-agent)) that can query your screen data, call APIs, write files, and take actions.

**a pipe is just one file: `pipe.md`**

```
~/.screenpipe/pipes/
├── daily-journal/
│   └── pipe.md
├── toggl-sync/
│   ├── pipe.md
│   └── .env          # secrets (api keys)
└── obsidian-sync/
    └── pipe.md
```

## creating a pipe

create a folder in `~/.screenpipe/pipes/` with a `pipe.md` file:

```bash
mkdir -p ~/.screenpipe/pipes/my-pipe
cat > ~/.screenpipe/pipes/my-pipe/pipe.md << 'EOF'
---
name: my-pipe
schedule: every 30m
lookback: 30m
enabled: true
---

Summarize my screen activity for the last 30 minutes.
Query screenpipe at http://localhost:3030/search.
Write the summary to ./output/{{date}}.md
EOF
```

## pipe.md format

every pipe.md starts with YAML frontmatter between `---` markers, followed by the prompt:

```markdown
---
name: my-pipe
schedule: every 2h
lookback: 2h
enabled: true
agent: pi
model: claude-haiku-4-5@20251001
---

Your prompt goes here. This is what the AI agent will execute.
You can reference screenpipe's API, write files, call external APIs, etc.
```

### frontmatter fields

| field | required | default | description |
|-------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `name` | no | folder name | pipe identifier |
| `schedule` | yes | `manual` | `every 1m`, `every 30m`, `every 2h`, `daily`, `manual` |
| `lookback` | no | matches schedule | how far back to query screen data: `30m`, `2h`, `8h` |
| `enabled` | no | `true` | whether the scheduler runs this pipe |
| `agent` | no | `pi` | which coding agent CLI to use |
| `model` | no | `claude-haiku-4-5@20251001` | which LLM the agent uses |

### template variables

these get replaced in the prompt body before execution:

| variable | example value |
|----------|---------------|
| `{{start_time}}` | `2026-02-11T20:00:00Z` |
| `{{end_time}}` | `2026-02-11T20:30:00Z` |
| `{{date}}` | `2026-02-11` |
| `{{timezone}}` | `PST` |
| `{{timezone_offset}}` | `-08:00` |

## cli commands

```bash
# list all pipes
screenpipe pipe list

# install a pipe from file, folder, or URL
screenpipe pipe install ./my-pipe.md
screenpipe pipe install https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user/repo/main/pipe.md

# enable/disable
screenpipe pipe enable my-pipe
screenpipe pipe disable my-pipe

# run once manually
screenpipe pipe run my-pipe

# view run history
screenpipe pipe logs my-pipe

# delete
screenpipe pipe delete my-pipe
```

## http api

when screenpipe is running, pipes are also manageable via the local API:

```bash
# list all pipes
curl http://localhost:3030/pipes

# run a pipe
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/pipes/my-pipe/run

# enable/disable
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/pipes/my-pipe/enable \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"enabled": true}'

# view logs
curl http://localhost:3030/pipes/my-pipe/logs

# install from URL
curl -X POST http://localhost:3030/pipes/install \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"source": "https://example.com/pipe.md"}'
```

## app ui

go to **settings → pipes** to see all installed pipes, toggle them on/off, run them manually, and view logs.

## examples

### time tracking (toggl)

```markdown
---
name: toggl-sync
schedule: every 1m
lookback: 2m
enabled: true
---

You automatically update my Toggl time tracking based on screen activity.

1. Query screenpipe: curl "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=ocr&limit=20&start_time={{start_time}}&end_time={{end_time}}"
2. Read API key: source .env
3. Check current Toggl timer
4. If activity changed, stop old timer and start new one
5. If activity matches, do nothing

Activity rules:
- VSCode/Cursor/Terminal → "coding"
- Chrome with GitHub → "code review"
- Slack/Discord → "communication"
- Zoom/Meet → "meeting"
```

### daily journal (obsidian)

```markdown
---
name: daily-journal
schedule: every 2h
lookback: 2h
enabled: true
---

Summarize my screen activity into a daily journal entry.
Query screenpipe at http://localhost:3030/search.
Write to ~/obsidian-vault/screenpipe/{{date}}.md
Use [[wiki-links]] for people and projects.
Include timeline deep links: [time](screenpipe://timeline?timestamp=ISO8601)
```

### standup report

```markdown
---
name: standup
schedule: daily
lookback: 8h
enabled: true
---

Generate a standup report from yesterday's screen activity.
Format: what I did, what I'm doing, blockers.
Write to ./output/{{date}}.md
```

## secrets

store API keys in `.env` files inside the pipe folder:

```bash
echo "TOGGL_API_KEY=your_key_here" > ~/.screenpipe/pipes/toggl-sync/.env
```

the pipe prompt can reference them: `source .env && curl -u $TOGGL_API_KEY:api_token ...`

**never put secrets in pipe.md** — the prompt may be visible in logs.

## architecture

```
pipe.md (prompt + config)
  → pipe manager (parses frontmatter, schedules runs)
    → agent executor (pi, claude-code, etc.)
      → agent queries screenpipe API + executes actions
        → output saved to pipe folder
```

- **agent ≠ model**: the agent is the CLI tool (pi, claude-code). the model is the LLM (haiku, opus, llama).
- **one pipe runs at a time** (global semaphore prevents overlap)
- **lookback capped at 8h** to prevent context overflow
- **logs saved** to `~/.screenpipe/pipes/{name}/logs/` as JSON

## built-in pipes

screenpipe ships with two template pipes (disabled by default):

- **obsidian-sync** — sync screen activity to obsidian vault
- **reminders** — scan activity for todos and create apple reminders
