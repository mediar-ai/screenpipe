- use the imperative mood ("move cursor to..." not "moves cursor to...")
- limit the first line to 72 characters or less
- reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line

### rust styleguide

all rust code must adhere to [rust style guide](https://github.com/rust-lang/style-team/blob/master/guide/guide.md).

we follow [this](https://doc.rust-lang.org/cargo/guide/project-layout.html) folder structure.

## additional notes

### ai system prompt

i use cursor with this prompt to help me with the code:

```
Rules:
- Coding: louis is working on screenpipe most of the time, it's an open source app, lib, and CLI, that record screens & mics 24/7, extract OCR & STT, save to local db, connect to AI, do magic, it's written in Rust + Tauri and we write plugins (pipes) in TS + Deno. the Rust CLI is embedded as a sidecar in Tauri. it works on macos, windows, linux
- Coding: always keep my style black and white, with some nerdy style and fonts pixelated / scientific style
- Coding: do not remove @ts-ignore except if i explicitly ask you
- Coding: always use lower case for logging stuff or UI
- Coding: Rust: always use anyhow error, tokio instead of std stuff, avoid mutex if you can, prefer channels, write code easy to read for humans, fast for machines
- Coding: when i ask to give me the full code it means FULL, no fucking // rest of the code comments GIVE ME THE FULL CODE
- Coding: if it seems like you lack some context about a niche lib just ask me to provide the source code and i will (instead of providing a bad answer)
- Coding: NextJS: make sure to use tailwind, typescript, shadcn, lucide, magicui, and framer-motion to make UIs amazing
- Coding: Make sure to escape html thing like quotes etc properly. Only when necessary
- Coding: When writing react or html code make sure to use thing like &apos; instead of ". Only when necessary (e.g inside quote themselves)
```


### principles 

- **user fanatic: focus on building what people want and bring maximum value.**
- concurrency: channels > mutexes/locks
- simplicity: avoid premature optimization. write code that is easy for humans to read, fast for machines to execute. less is more. optimise for less code, less files, less dependencies, less complexity.
- production: we're building real products, not python toy that grow to 150k stars and die prematurely and never leave localhost, thank you.
- focus: avoid feature creep. focus on the core functionality and build upon it. focus on the user and their needs.
- use numbers: if you can't measure it, you can't improve it.
- avoid oop: prefer functional programming.
- positive-sum: we're all going to win, it is a multiplayer, positive sum game. (that escalated quickly)

### issue and pull request labels

this section lists the labels we use to help us track and manage issues and pull requests.

* `bug` - issues that are bugs.
* `enhancement` - issues that are feature requests.
* `documentation` - issues or pull requests related to documentation.
* `good first issue` - good for newcomers.

## building

```bash
cargo build --release --features metal # or cuda, depending on your computer's NPU
```

## running tests

before submitting a pull request, run all the tests to ensure nothing has broken:

```bash
cargo test
# on macos you need to set DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH for apple native OCR tests to run
DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH=$(pwd)/screenpipe-vision/lib cargo test
```

you can add env var to `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
    "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
        "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "$(pwd)/screenpipe-vision/lib"
    }
}
```

this is @louis030195 whole `.vscode/settings.json` file:

```json
{
    "rust-analyzer.server.extraEnv": {
        "PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS": "1",
        "PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS": "1",
        "PKG_CONFIG_PATH": "/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/homebrew/share/pkgconfig",
        "PATH": "/usr/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:${env:PATH}",
        "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
    },
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.extraEnv": {
        "PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_LIBS": "1",
        "PKG_CONFIG_ALLOW_SYSTEM_CFLAGS": "1",
        "PKG_CONFIG_PATH": "/opt/homebrew/lib/pkgconfig:/opt/homebrew/share/pkgconfig",
        "PATH": "/usr/bin:/opt/homebrew/bin:${env:PATH}",
        "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}"
    },
    // add env to integrated terminal
    "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
        "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}",
        "SCREENPIPE_APP_DEV": "true",
    },
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": [
        "pipes"
    ],
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.runBuildScripts": true,
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.command": "clippy",
    "rust-analyzer.checkOnSave.extraArgs": [
        "--features",
        "pipes"
    ],
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.allFeatures": false,
    "rust-analyzer.cargo.noDefaultFeatures": false
}
```


## other hacks

### debugging github action

ssh into the runner:

```yaml
- name: Setup tmate session # HACK
  if: matrix.platform == 'windows-latest'
  uses: mxschmitt/action-tmate@v3
```

run locally: https://github.com/nektos/act


### debugging memory errors

```bash
RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=address" cargo run --bin screenpipe
# or
RUSTFLAGS="-Z sanitizer=leak" cargo run --bin screenpipe
```

for performance monitoring, you can use the following command:

```bash
cargo install cargo-instruments
# tracking leaks over 60 minutes time limit
cargo instruments -t Leaks --bin screenpipe --features metal --time-limit 600000 --open
```

then open the file in `target/release/instruments` using xcode -> open developer tool -> instruments.


### benchmarks

```
cargo bench
```

[check benchmark visuals](https://mediar-ai.github.io/screenpipe/dev/bench/)

### creating new migrations

```bash
cargo install sqlx-cli
sqlx migrate add <migration_name>
```

### set up azure ubuntu vm with display & audio

```bash
# Set variables
RG_NAME="my-avd-rgg"
LOCATION="westus2" 
VM_NAME="ubuntu-avd"
IMAGE="Canonical:0001-com-ubuntu-server-jammy:22_04-lts-gen2:latest"
VM_SIZE="Standard_D2s_v3"  

# Create resource group
az group create --name $RG_NAME --location $LOCATION

# Create VM
az vm create \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --image $IMAGE \
  --admin-username azureuser \
  --generate-ssh-keys \
  --size $VM_SIZE

# Enable RDP
az vm open-port --port 3389 --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $VM_NAME

# Install xrdp, audio, and desktop environment
az vm run-command invoke \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --command-id RunShellScript \
  --scripts "
    sudo apt update && sudo apt install -y xrdp ubuntu-desktop pulseaudio
    sudo systemctl enable xrdp
    sudo adduser xrdp ssl-cert
    echo 'startxfce4' | sudo tee /etc/xrdp/startwm.sh
    sudo systemctl restart xrdp
    sudo ufw allow 3389/tcp
  "

# Enable audio redirection
az vm run-command invoke \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --command-id RunShellScript \
  --scripts "
    echo 'load-module module-native-protocol-tcp auth-anonymous=1' | sudo tee -a /etc/pulse/default.pa
    sudo systemctl restart pulseaudio
  "

# Get IP address
IP=$(az vm list-ip-addresses --resource-group $RG_NAME --name $VM_NAME --output table | grep -oE "\b([0-9]{1,3}\.){3}[0-9]{1,3}\b" | head -1)

# Now you can open Microsoft Remote Desktop and use the IP in new PC to connect to it

# RDP into the VM
ssh azureuser@$IP

# Forwarding port to local 
ssh -L 13389:localhost:3389 azureuser@$IP

# Changing password
az vm user update \
  --resource-group $RG_NAME \
  --name $VM_NAME \
  --username azureuser \
  --password <new-password>
```

now you can either dev screenpipe on linux or run screenpipe in the cloud that record your local macos. make sure to configure microsoft remote desktop to forward audio
