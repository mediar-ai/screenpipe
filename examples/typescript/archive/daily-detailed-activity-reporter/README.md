pnpm i
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your key>"
# or leave empty and use ollama (you will be prompted choice)
pnpx tsx main.ts
```

i don't recommend using openai here, it could use lot of tokens 

bad experience with small ollama models (fail function calls)

llama3.1, mistral-nemo are decent (7/13b)
