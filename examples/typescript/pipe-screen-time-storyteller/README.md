## Usage

The Screen Time Storyteller pipe will run automatically as part of your Screenpipe workflow. It generates a narrative summary every hour based on your screen activities from the past 24 hours.

You can find the generated summaries in two places:

1. A JSON file in the `.screenpipe/pipes/screen-time-storyteller/` directory, named with the current date (e.g., `2024-10-06-narrative-summary.json`).
2. A GitHub gist, which you can access through your GitHub account.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check Screenpipe's logs for any error messages related to the Screen Time Storyteller pipe.
2. Ensure your API keys and GitHub token are correct and have the necessary permissions.
3. Verify that the pipe's directory is in the correct location within your Screenpipe installation.
