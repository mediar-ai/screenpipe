## recall privacy concerns

Microsoft Recall has faced criticism for:

- storing sensitive data (passwords, financial info)
- potential security vulnerabilities
- data being accessible to other apps
- unclear data handling policies

screenpipe addresses these:

- **PII removal**: optional automatic redaction of sensitive data
- **window filtering**: exclude apps like password managers
- **local-only**: data never leaves your device
- **open source**: security researchers can audit the code

## filtering sensitive content

```bash
# exclude password managers and banking apps
bunx screenpipe \
  --ignored-windows "1Password" \
  --ignored-windows "Bitwarden" \
  --ignored-windows "Chase" \
  --use-pii-removal
```

## get started

```bash
bunx screenpipe
```
