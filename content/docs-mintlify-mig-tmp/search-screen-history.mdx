screenpipe records your screen 24/7 and lets you search through everything using natural language. find that code snippet, conversation, or document you saw last week.

## how it works

1. **continuous capture**: screenpipe records your screen at configurable intervals (default: 1 frame/second)
2. **OCR extraction**: text is extracted from every frame using native OCR engines
3. **local storage**: everything is stored in a local SQLite database
4. **AI search**: query your data using natural language or filters

## search examples

### find by text content

```typescript
import { pipe } from "@screenpipe/js";

// find mentions of a project
const results = await pipe.queryScreenpipe({
  q: "project apollo budget",
  contentType: "ocr",
  limit: 20
});
```

### find by application

```typescript
// find all VS Code activity from today
const results = await pipe.queryScreenpipe({
  appName: "Code",
  startTime: new Date().toISOString().split('T')[0],
  contentType: "ocr"
});
```

### find by time range

```typescript
// find what you were doing yesterday afternoon
const yesterday = new Date(Date.now() - 24 * 60 * 60 * 1000);
yesterday.setHours(14, 0, 0, 0);
const yesterdayEnd = new Date(yesterday);
yesterdayEnd.setHours(18, 0, 0, 0);

const results = await pipe.queryScreenpipe({
  startTime: yesterday.toISOString(),
  endTime: yesterdayEnd.toISOString(),
  contentType: "all"
});
```

## using the search interface

the easiest way to search is using the built-in search in the screenpipe desktop app:

1. open screenpipe desktop app
2. click on the search icon or use the timeline view
3. use natural language to find anything from your screen history
4. scroll through your day visually with the timeline

## search tips

- **be specific**: "slack message from john about deployment" works better than "deployment"
- **use time context**: "yesterday's standup meeting" or "last week's code review"
- **combine filters**: app name + time range + keywords for precise results

## privacy

- all search happens locally on your device
- no data leaves your computer
- you control what apps are recorded with `--ignored-windows` and `--included-windows`

## next steps
