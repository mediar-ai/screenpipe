<Expandable title="what are pipes?">
  pipes are scheduled AI agents that run on your screen data. each pipe is a `.md` file with a prompt and a schedule. an AI agent reads the prompt, queries the screenpipe API, and takes action.

  examples: sync to Obsidian, track time in Toggl, send daily summaries.

  see the [pipes guide](/pipes) for details.
