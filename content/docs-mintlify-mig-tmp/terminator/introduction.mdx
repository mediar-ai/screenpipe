## overview

**terminator** is the playwright-style sdk for automating windows gui apps. ai-native gui automation for windows, macos, linux. fast, reliable, agent-ready.

automate desktop apps like a browser with **80ms ui scans** and **10000x speedup** via compiled workflows. because it uses os-level accessibility apis, it is **100x faster and more reliable** for ai computer use than vision-based approaches like openai operator or anthropic computer use.

> **note:** built for windows, works on macos (partial support), linux support coming soon.

## ðŸ§  what is terminator?

terminator is designed for ai agents, not humans. it provides:

- ðŸªŸ native support for windows, partial macos compatibility
- ðŸ§  built specifically for ai agents
- âš¡ uses os-level accessibility (not vision) for speed
- ðŸ§© typescript, python, and rust support
- ðŸ“ˆ 80ms ui scans with massive performance advantages

## benchmarks

the [benchmark test](https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator/blob/main/terminator/src/tests/e2e_tests.rs) illustrates how fast terminator can query the ui. it finds all edit elements in about **80 ms**, showcasing a big speed advantage over vision-based tools.

this [form-filling app](https://www.mediar.ai/) can read & fill 1000 input forms as soon as you see them in \<1s end-to-end using gemini.

## technical details & debugging

### key dependencies

- **windows:** [uiautomation-rs](https://github.com/leexgone/uiautomation-rs)
- **macos:** native macos accessibility api (exploring [cidre](https://github.com/yury/cidre) as an alternative)

### debugging tools

**windows:**

- [accessibility insights for windows](https://accessibilityinsights.io/downloads/)
- **flauinspect:** a recommended alternative for inspecting ui automation properties on windows.
  - install: `choco install flauinspect` or download from [flaui/flauinspect releases](https://github.com/flaui/flauinspect/releases).
  - usage: launch `flauinspect.exe`, hover or click on elements to see properties like `automationid`, `name`, and `controltype`. this is great for debugging selectors.
