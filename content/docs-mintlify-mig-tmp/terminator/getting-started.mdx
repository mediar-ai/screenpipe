## installation

first, clone the terminator repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/terminator
cd terminator
```

## running the server

**terminator** works with a client-server architecture. you need to run the rust server first. this server listens for commands from the sdk (typescript, python) and interacts with the operating system's accessibility apis.

```bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\setup_windows.ps1
./server_release/server.exe --debug
```

the `--debug` flag enables verbose logging, which is helpful when starting out.

**run an example client (in another terminal):**

```bash
cd examples/hello-world
npm i
npm run dev
# open http://localhost:3000
```

## next steps

*   explore the sdk references ([TypeScript](/terminator/js-sdk-reference), [Python](/terminator/python-sdk-reference)) to understand all available commands.
*   look at the `examples/` directory for more usage patterns.
*   start building your own automation scripts!
