[Obsidian](https://obsidian.md) is a powerful knowledge base that works on local markdown files. with screenpipe, you can query your screen history and meeting transcriptions directly from Obsidian using AI plugins.

## setup with copilot plugin

the [Obsidian Copilot](https://github.com/logancyang/obsidian-copilot) plugin supports MCP servers, letting you query screenpipe from within Obsidian.

1. install the Copilot plugin from Obsidian community plugins
2. open Copilot settings → MCP Servers
3. add screenpipe:

```json
{
  "screenpipe": {
    "command": "npx",
    "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
  }
}
```

4. restart Obsidian

now you can ask Copilot things like:
- "what was I reading about yesterday?"
- "find my meeting notes from this morning"
- "what code was I looking at in VS Code?"

## manual workflow

if you prefer not to use plugins, you can query screenpipe's API and paste results into notes:

```bash
# search recent screen content
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=meeting&limit=10" | jq '.data[].content.text'

# get audio transcriptions from today
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?content_type=audio&limit=20"
```

## use cases

- **daily notes**: automatically pull what you worked on into daily notes
- **meeting notes**: capture transcriptions and screen context from meetings
- **research**: recall articles and documentation you've read
- **project logs**: track what you've done across different apps

## requirements

- screenpipe running on localhost:3030
- Obsidian with Copilot plugin (for MCP integration)
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
