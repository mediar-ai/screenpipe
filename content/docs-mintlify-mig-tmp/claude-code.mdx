[Claude Code](https://docs.anthropic.com/en/docs/claude-code) is Anthropic's official CLI for agentic coding. with screenpipe integration, Claude can reference what you've been working on, recall information from your screen, and access meeting transcriptions.

## setup

Claude Code uses [Agent Skills](https://opencode.ai/docs/skills) via the `.claude/agents/` folder. screenpipe provides pre-built agents you can copy to your project or home directory.

### option 1: copy agents to your project

```bash
# clone screenpipe repo
git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe

# copy agents to your project
cp -r screenpipe/.claude/agents/* your-project/.claude/agents/
```

### option 2: copy to home directory (global)

```bash
# copy to home directory for all projects
mkdir -p ~/.claude/agents
cp -r screenpipe/.claude/agents/* ~/.claude/agents/
```

## available agents

screenpipe provides these specialized agents:

| agent | description |
|-------|-------------|
| `screenpipe-query` | search screen OCR, audio transcriptions, UI elements |
| `screenpipe-health` | check status, diagnose issues, verify permissions |
| `screenpipe-logs` | retrieve and analyze screenpipe logs for debugging |

## usage

once agents are installed, Claude Code automatically discovers them. reference them in your prompts:

```bash
# in Claude Code CLI
claude

> use screenpipe-query to find what I was reading about kubernetes yesterday

> check screenpipe-health to see if recording is working

> use screenpipe-logs to find any errors from today
```

## agent capabilities

### screenpipe-query

searches your recorded data:

```bash
# REST API queries
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=QUERY&limit=20"
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=QUERY&content_type=ocr"
curl "http://localhost:3030/search?q=QUERY&app_name=Cursor"

# direct SQL queries
sqlite3 ~/.screenpipe/db.sqlite "SELECT * FROM ocr_text ORDER BY frame_id DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### screenpipe-health

diagnoses issues:

- checks if screenpipe process is running
- verifies API is responding
- checks disk usage and database integrity
- validates macos permissions (screen recording, microphone)

### screenpipe-logs

analyzes logs for debugging:

- retrieves today's logs from `~/.screenpipe/`
- filters errors and warnings
- searches for specific issues

## example workflows

**recall context from earlier:**
```
> I was reading a blog post about rust async earlier today,
> use screenpipe to find it and summarize the key points
```

**reference meeting discussion:**
```
> use screenpipe to find what was discussed in my standup
> about the API refactor, then help me implement it
```

**debug with screen history:**
```
> I saw an error message flash on screen, use screenpipe
> to find it and help me fix the issue
```

**find code examples:**
```
> use screenpipe to find the python code I was looking at
> in the browser yesterday about asyncio patterns
```

## requirements

- screenpipe running on localhost:3030
- Claude Code CLI installed (`npm install -g @anthropic-ai/claude-code`)
- agents copied to `.claude/agents/` (project or home directory)

## troubleshooting

**agents not showing up?**
- verify files exist in `.claude/agents/` or `~/.claude/agents/`
- check yaml frontmatter is valid in each agent file
- restart Claude Code

**queries returning empty?**
- verify screenpipe is running: `curl http://localhost:3030/health`
- check screenpipe has data: `curl "http://localhost:3030/search?limit=1"`
- ensure screen recording permissions are granted

**permission errors?**
- macos: check System Settings > Privacy & Security > Screen Recording
- ensure screenpipe app/CLI is listed and enabled
