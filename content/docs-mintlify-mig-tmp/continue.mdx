[Continue](https://github.com/continuedev/continue) is an open-source AI coding assistant with 20k+ GitHub stars. it works in VS Code and JetBrains IDEs, and supports MCP servers for external context.

## setup

### VS Code

1. install Continue from the VS Code marketplace
2. open Continue settings
3. edit `~/.continue/config.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": [
    {
      "name": "screenpipe",
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  ]
}
```

4. restart VS Code

### JetBrains

1. install Continue from JetBrains marketplace
2. open Continue settings
3. add the same MCP configuration
4. restart the IDE

## usage

once configured, Continue can access your screen history:

```
> @screenpipe what was I working on this morning?

> find the error I saw in my terminal and help me fix it

> what documentation was I reading about react hooks?
```

## context providers

Continue also supports context providers. you can add screenpipe as a custom context provider for more control:

```json
{
  "contextProviders": [
    {
      "name": "screenpipe",
      "params": {
        "apiUrl": "http://localhost:3030"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

## example workflows

**code with context:**
```
> I was looking at how another project handles authentication,
> find that code and help me implement something similar
```

**recall errors:**
```
> there was a typescript error earlier about types,
> find it and explain how to fix it
```

**meeting follow-up:**
```
> what did we discuss in the standup about the API changes?
> help me implement those changes
```

## available tools

via MCP, Continue gets access to:

- **search-content** - search screen OCR and audio transcriptions
- **search-ui-events** - search accessibility data: keyboard input, clicks, app switches, clipboard (macOS)
- **get-ui-event-stats** - aggregated app usage statistics
- **export-video** - create video exports from screen recordings

## requirements

- screenpipe running on localhost:3030
- Continue extension in VS Code or JetBrains
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
