screenpipe records your screen continuously and makes everything searchable. it runs locally, stores data on your machine, and provides APIs for AI integration.

## what it does

- **captures screen 24/7** — OCR extracts text from every frame
- **local storage** — sqlite database + media files on your machine
- **search API** — find anything you've seen via `localhost:3030/search`
- **pipes** — scheduled AI agents that act on your screen data ([learn more](/pipes))
- **MCP server** — connect to Claude, Cursor, and other AI assistants ([learn more](/mcp-server))

## quick start

```bash
# install and run
bunx screenpipe

# or download the desktop app
