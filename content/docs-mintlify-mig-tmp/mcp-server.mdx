Screenpipe offers robust capabilities for integrating with various MCP clients, allowing users to leverage its features across different platforms. This guide will walk you through the setup and usage of Screenpipe with supported MCP clients.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the MCP server, ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. Python

Install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

### 2. uv Package Manager

Install uv using one of these commands based on your operating system:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="macOS/Linux">
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation by running:

```bash
uv --version
```

## Supported MCP Clients

- [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop)
- [Cursor IDE](#cursor-ide)

## Setting Up the MCP Server

To set up the MCP server, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
screenpipe mcp setup
```

Upon successful setup, you will see the following confirmation:

```
MCP setup completed successfully
Directory: C:\Users\divan\.screenpipe\mcp
Config file: C:\Users\divan\.screenpipe\mcp\config.json

To run the MCP server, use this command:
$ uv --directory C:\Users\divan\.screenpipe\mcp run screenpipe-mcp --port 3030
```

## Configuration

The configuration for the MCP server is stored in `config.json` located in the `.screenpipe\mcp` directory. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Users\\divan\\.screenpipe\\mcp",
        "run",
        "screenpipe-mcp",
        "--port",
        "3030"
      ],
      "command": "uv"
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Desktop

Screenpipe integrates with **Claude Desktop**, allowing seamless interaction via MCP. Follow this guide to set it up properly.

### 1. Open the Configuration File

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Windows">
    Open the configuration file using Notepad:

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="PowerShell">
        ```powershell
        notepad $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json  
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="CMD">
        ```cmd
        notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json  
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="macOS">
    Open the configuration file using your preferred editor (e.g., VSCode, Cursor, or Vim):

    ```bash
    code "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"  
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

### 2. Update the Configuration

Modify the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to include the following configuration:

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "screenpipe": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "C:\\Users\\divan\\.screenpipe\\mcp",
                "run",
                "screenpipe-mcp",
                "--port",
                "3030"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```

> **Note:** Ensure that this configuration matches the generated `config.json` by the [MCP server setup](#setting-up-the-mcp-server).

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop

After making changes to the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to apply the updates.

If the setup is successful, you'll see a **hammer icon** appear in the interface.

## Cursor IDE

Screenpipe MCP can be integrated with **Cursor IDE** to make it available across all your projects. Follow these steps to set it up.

### 1. Open Cursor Settings

- Launch **Cursor IDE**.
- Click on the **gear icon** to open **Settings**.

- If the configuration file doesn't exist yet, click **"Create File"** (as shown in Cursor IDE).
- Paste the configuration from the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### 3. Restart MCP in Cursor

- Navigate back to the **Cursor Settings** tab.
- Click the **refresh icon** next to MCP servers.

  </Frame>

That's it\! Now Cursor IDE should recognize and use the Screenpipe MCP server.

- Start by opening a new Composer and enable Agent mode
- From there onwards you can use this tool
