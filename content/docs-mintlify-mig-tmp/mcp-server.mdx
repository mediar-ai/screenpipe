screenpipe provides an MCP (Model Context Protocol) server that lets AI assistants like Claude and Cursor search your screen recordings, audio transcriptions, and control your computer.

## claude desktop

### option 1: one-click install (recommended)

the easiest way to connect screenpipe to Claude Desktop:

1. open the **screenpipe app**
2. go to **settings** → **connections**
3. click **"install extension"** next to Claude Desktop
4. Claude will open and prompt you to confirm the installation
5. click **install** in Claude's dialog

that's it! try asking Claude: *"what did I do in the last 5 minutes?"*

<Tip>
make sure screenpipe is running when you use Claude with screenpipe features.

### option 2: npx (manual)

    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="windows">
    ```powershell
    notepad $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

add this configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

restart Claude Desktop after saving.

### option 3: from source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe
cd screenpipe/screenpipe-integrations/screenpipe-mcp
npm install
npm run build

  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/screenpipe-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## cursor ide

to use with Cursor:

1. open **cursor settings** (gear icon)
2. select **mcp** in the sidebar
3. click **"add new global mcp server"**
4. paste the npx configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  }

- full text search with content type filtering (OCR/audio/UI)
- time range and app/window filtering
- pagination support

### control tools (macos)

- **find-elements** - find UI elements in applications by role
- **click-element** - click UI elements by accessibility ID

- "find audio transcriptions from the last hour"
- "show me what was on my screen in VS Code yesterday"
- "open Safari and go to github.com"
- "find the search button in Chrome and click it"

## testing

test your setup with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx screenpipe-mcp
```

## requirements

- screenpipe must be running on localhost:3030
- Node.js >= 18.0.0
- macos automation features require accessibility permissions

## mintlify mcp (use our docs in cursor, claude)

add our docs as context in your AI assistant:

```bash
npx mint-mcp add mediar-ai
```

## troubleshooting

**mcp not connecting?**
- ensure screenpipe is running (`screenpipe` in terminal)
- check it's accessible at http://localhost:3030/health
- restart Claude Desktop / Cursor after config changes

**macos automation not working?**
- grant accessibility permissions in System Settings > Privacy & Security > Accessibility
