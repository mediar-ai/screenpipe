- use local AI models (Ollama)
- no cloud dependency
- audit the source code yourself

### no cloud dependency

screenpipe runs entirely on your device. no cloud account required.

### extensible

build custom integrations:

```typescript
import { pipe } from "@screenpipe/js";

// create your own AI workflows
const context = await pipe.queryScreenpipe({
  contentType: "all",
  limit: 50
});

// process with any AI provider
const summary = await generateSummary(context);
```

## for meeting transcription

screenpipe handles meetings just as well:

```bash
# capture system audio (meeting apps) + microphone
screenpipe \
  --audio-device "MacBook Pro Microphone" \
  --audio-device "BlackHole 2ch"
```

install the **meeting** pipe for automatic summaries and action items.
