Limitless.ai offers an AI-powered pendant and app for recording meetings and conversations. screenpipe provides similar AI memory capabilities but entirely self-hosted and open source.

## comparison

| feature | screenpipe | limitless |
|---------|-----------|-----------|
| **hardware** | uses your existing devices | requires pendant |
| **open source** | yes (MIT) | no |
| **data location** | 100% local | cloud-based |
| **platforms** | macOS, Windows, Linux | iOS, web |

## why choose screenpipe?

### no hardware purchase

use your existing computer, microphone, and webcam. no additional hardware required.

### screen + audio

limitless only captures audio. screenpipe captures:
- screen content with OCR
- audio transcription
- UI elements (experimental)

### complete privacy

- all data stays on your device
- use local AI models (Ollama)
- no cloud dependency
- audit the source code yourself

### no cloud dependency

screenpipe runs entirely on your device. no cloud account required.

### extensible

build custom integrations:

```typescript
import { pipe } from "@screenpipe/js";

// create your own AI workflows
const context = await pipe.queryScreenpipe({
  contentType: "all",
  limit: 50
});

// process with any AI provider
const summary = await generateSummary(context);
```

## for meeting transcription

screenpipe handles meetings just as well:

```bash
# capture system audio (meeting apps) + microphone
screenpipe \
  --audio-device "MacBook Pro Microphone" \
  --audio-device "BlackHole 2ch"
```

install the **meeting** pipe for automatic summaries and action items.
