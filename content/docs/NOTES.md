  This can happen on Windows.

  - Type "environment" in the search bar of Windows, and click environment variables.
  - Click "new" (the first one).
  - The key will be `TESSDATA_PREFIX` and the value will be the path you installed screenpipe (default is `C:\Users\<your username>\AppData\Local\screenpipe`)

  You can also try our experimental Windows OCR engine by adding `--ocr-engine windows-native` which should solve the above problem too
