# Using Screenpipe with MCP Clients

Screenpipe offers robust capabilities for integrating with various MCP clients, allowing users to leverage its features across different platforms. This guide will walk you through the setup and usage of Screenpipe with supported MCP clients.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up the MCP server, ensure you have the following installed:

### 1. Python
Install Python from the [official Python website](https://www.python.org/). Make sure to add Python to your system's PATH during installation.

### 2. uv Package Manager
Install uv using one of these commands based on your operating system:

<Tabs items={['macOS/Linux', 'Windows']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash
    curl -LsSf https://astral.sh/uv/install.sh | sh
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```powershell
    powershell -ExecutionPolicy ByPass -c "irm https://astral.sh/uv/install.ps1 | iex"
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

Verify the installation by running:
```bash
uv --version
```

## Supported MCP Clients

- [Claude Desktop](#claude-desktop)
- [5ire Desktop App](#5ire-desktop-app)
- [Cursor IDE](#cursor-ide)

## Setting Up the MCP Server

To set up the MCP server, execute the following command in your terminal:

```bash
screenpipe mcp setup
```

Upon successful setup, you will see the following confirmation:

```
MCP setup completed successfully
Directory: C:\Users\divan\.screenpipe\mcp
Config file: C:\Users\divan\.screenpipe\mcp\config.json

To run the MCP server, use this command:
$ uv --directory C:\Users\divan\.screenpipe\mcp run screenpipe-mcp --port 3030
```

## Configuration

The configuration for the MCP server is stored in `config.json` located in the `.screenpipe\mcp` directory. Here is an example configuration:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "C:\\Users\\divan\\.screenpipe\\mcp",
        "run",
        "screenpipe-mcp",
        "--port",
        "3030"
      ],
      "command": "uv"
    }
  }
}
```

## Claude Desktop

Screenpipe integrates with **Claude Desktop**, allowing seamless interaction via MCP. Follow this guide to set it up properly.

### 1. Open the Configuration File  

<Tabs items={['Windows', 'Mac']}>  
  <Tab>  
  Open the configuration file using Notepad:  
    <Tabs items={['PowerShell', 'CMD']}>  
      <Tab>  
        ```powershell  
        notepad $env:AppData\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json  
        ```  
      </Tab>  
      <Tab>  
        ```cmd  
        notepad %APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json  
        ```  
      </Tab>  
    </Tabs>  
  </Tab>  
  <Tab>  
    Open the configuration file using your preferred editor (e.g., VSCode, Cursor, or Vim):  
    ```bash  
    code "~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json"  
    ```  
  </Tab>  
</Tabs>  

### 2. Update the Configuration  

Modify the `claude_desktop_config.json` file to include the following configuration:  

```json
{
    "mcpServers": {
        "screenpipe": {
            "command": "uv",
            "args": [
                "--directory",
                "C:\\Users\\divan\\.screenpipe\\mcp",
                "run",
                "screenpipe-mcp",
                "--port",
                "3030"
            ]
        }
    }
}
```  

> **Note:** Ensure that this configuration matches the generated `config.json` by the [MCP server setup](#setting-up-the-mcp-server).  

### 3. Restart Claude Desktop  

After making changes to the configuration, restart Claude Desktop to apply the updates.  

<Image  
  src="/claude-setup.gif"  
  alt="Claude Desktop App"  
  width={800}  
  height={450}  
  className="rounded-lg"
  unoptimized 
/>  

If the setup is successful, you'll see a **hammer icon** appear in the interface.  

## 5ire Desktop App

Screenpipe allows seamless integration with the **5ire Desktop App**, enabling users to utilize its features efficiently. This guide walks you through the setup process.

Before configuring the 5ire Desktop App, you need to set up the **MCP server**. If you haven't done so yet, refer to the following [MCP Server Setup](#setting-up-the-mcp-server) :

### 1. Open the 5ire Desktop App
Launch the **5ire Desktop App** on your system.

### 2. Configure the MCP Tool
- Click on **"Tools"** from the left sidebar.
- Click on the **"New"** button to add a new tool.
- In the **"Tool Key"** field, enter:  
  ```
  screenpipe
  ```

### 3. Enter the Command
In the **"Command"** field, enter the **MCP server run command** obtained from the setup:

```
uv --directory C:\Users\divan\.screenpipe\mcp run screenpipe-mcp --port 3030
```

> **Note:** This command is the same as the one shown in the [MCP Server Setup](#setting-up-the-mcp-server) section.

### 4. Save the Configuration
Click the **"Save"** button to finalize the setup.
    <Image 
      src="/5ire-setup.gif" 
      alt="5ire Desktop App" 
      width={800} 
      height={450}
      className="rounded-lg"
      unoptimized
    />

### 5. Enable the Tool
After saving, toggle the switch to **enable** the tool.

### 6. Start Using Screenpipe
Once enabled, navigate to **New Chat** and begin using Screenpipe within the 5ire Desktop App.


## Cursor IDE


Screenpipe MCP can be integrated with **Cursor IDE** to make it available across all your projects. Follow these steps to set it up.

### 1. Open Cursor Settings
- Launch **Cursor IDE**.
- Click on the **gear icon** to open **Settings**.
- In the left sidebar, select **MCP**.

### 2. Add a Global MCP Server
- Click on **"Add New Global MCP Server"**.
- If the configuration file doesn't exist yet, click **"Create File"** (as shown in Cursor IDE).
- Paste the configuration from the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

### 3. Restart MCP in Cursor
- Navigate back to the **Cursor Settings** tab.
- Click the **refresh icon** next to MCP servers.
    <Image 
      src="/cursor-setup.gif" 
      alt="Cursor IDE" 
      width={800} 
      height={450}
      className="rounded-lg"
      unoptimized
    />

That's it! Now Cursor IDE should recognize and use the Screenpipe MCP server.
- Start by opening a new Composer and enable Agent mode
- From there onwards you can use this tool
