### iphone screen mirroring

make sure to update your iOS versions, then search for "iphone mirroring" in macos and follow the instructions

screenpipe will record the screen so you can search or do anything with it on the screenpipe app or using the screenpipe api

### iphone microphone recording

just enable bluetooth and select iphone in audio device list


#### experimental integrations

we have a bunch of experimental integrations available here:

https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/tree/main/examples/typescript

keep in mind it's quite easy to integrate with screenpipe:
1. get some data from screenpipe API 
2. send to a LLM 
3. call another API 

the best code will autonomously handle these steps by the LLM (just provide tools and infinite round trips until completion of goal)
