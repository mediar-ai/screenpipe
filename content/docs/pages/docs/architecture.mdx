# architecture overview

<MotionDiv>

screenpipe's architecture handles continuous screen and audio capture, local data storage, and real-time processing. here's a breakdown of the key components:

## diagram overview

![screenpipe diagram](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/main/content/diagram2.png)

1. **input**: screen and audio data
2. **processing**: ocr, stt, transcription, multimodal integration
3. **storage**: sqlite database
4. **plugins**: custom pipes
5. **integrations**: ollama, deepgram, notion, whatsapp, etc.

this modular architecture makes screenpipe adaptable to various use cases, from personal productivity tracking to advanced business intelligence.

### data abstraction layers

![screenpipe data abstractions](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/user-attachments/assets/93136194-0945-4eec-a9f1-f58eb9e440a4)

screenpipe organizes data in concentric layers of abstraction, from raw data to high-level intelligence:

1. **core (mp4 files)**: the innermost layer contains the raw screen recordings and audio captures in mp4 format
2. **processing layer**: contains the direct processing outputs
   - OCR embeddings: vectorized text extracted from screen
   - human id: anonymized user identification 
   - accessibility: metadata for improved data access
   - transcripts: processed audio-to-text
3. **AI memories**: the outermost layer represents the highest level of abstraction where AI processes and synthesizes all lower-level data into meaningful insights
4. **pipes enrich**: custom processing modules that can interact with and enhance data at any layer

this layered approach enables both granular access to raw data and sophisticated AI-powered insights while maintaining data privacy and efficiency.
