# getting started

<MotionDiv>

screenpipe offers multiple installation methods depending on user needs and technical proficiency. whether you are a developer looking to use the cli or a user who wants a more plug-and-play desktop app, screenpipe provides flexible options to get started quickly.

for non technical users or those who want to get started quickly, we recommend getting the [desktop app here](https://screenpi.pe/onboarding).

## 1. installation options

### cli installation

- **for technical users**: screenpipe can be installed and used via the command-line interface (cli).
- **instructions**:
  1. clone the repository.
  2. install dependencies (ensure rust, cargo, and any other required tools are installed).
  3. build the project and run the cli.

</MotionDiv>

### desktop app

- **paid desktop app**: offers priority support, 1-year updates, and exclusive features. users can download and install the desktop app directly from the official site.
- **free desktop app**: open-source and available to build yourself. installation requires building from the source code or sending a pr to the repository. both options provide a fully functional desktop application with all key features.

### manual build

for users preferring full control or customization, building the app manually from the repository is an option. this method requires rust and other necessary dependencies. follow the provided build guide to compile the app.

### **option 1: build from source (for advanced users)**

1. start by installing rust and all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   brew install pkg-config ffmpeg jq tesseract cmake wget
   ```

2. install deno cli (required for building):
   ```bash
   curl -fsSL https://deno.land/install.sh | sh

   ```

4. build the project with:
   ```bash
   cargo build --release --features metal
   ```

5. finally, run screenpipe:
   ```bash
   ./target/release/screenpipe
   ```

6. to build the desktop app:

add this to your vscode settings in the root of the project `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json
{
   "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": [
      "metal",
      "pipes"
   ],
   "rust-analyzer.server.extraEnv": {
      "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}",
      "SCREENPIPE_APP_DEV": "true"
   },
   "rust-analyzer.cargo.extraEnv": {
      "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}",
      "SCREENPIPE_APP_DEV": "true"
   },
   "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
      "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}",
      "SCREENPIPE_APP_DEV": "true"
   }
}
```

```bash
cd screenpipe-app-tauri
bun install
bun scripts/pre_build.js # <- this is important to copy the CLI into the app
bun tauri build
