# getting started

<MotionDiv>

screenpipe offers multiple installation methods depending on user needs and technical proficiency. whether you are a developer looking to use the cli or a user who wants a more plug-and-play desktop app, screenpipe provides flexible options to get started quickly.

for non technical users or those who want to get started quickly, we recommend getting the [desktop app here](https://screenpi.pe/onboarding).

### desktop app

- **paid desktop app**: offers priority support, 1-year updates, and exclusive features. users can download and install the desktop app directly from the official site.
- **free desktop app**: open-source and available to build yourself. installation requires building from the source code or sending a pr to the repository. both options provide a fully functional desktop application with all key features.

### manual build

for users preferring full control or customization, building the app manually from the repository is an option. this method requires rust and other necessary dependencies. follow the provided build guide to compile the app.
