# getting started

<MotionDiv>

screenpipe offers multiple installation methods depending on user needs and technical proficiency. whether you are a developer looking to use the cli or a user who wants a more plug-and-play desktop app, screenpipe provides flexible options to get started quickly.

for non technical users or those who want to get started quickly, we recommend getting the [desktop app here](https://screenpi.pe/onboarding).

quickly start the CLI on MacOS with:
```bash copy
brew tap mediar-ai/screenpipe https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe.git
brew install screenpipe
screenpipe
```

then 

```bash copy
git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe
open screenpipe-server/examples/timeline_ui_simple/index.html # or open manually in your browser
```

this will open a rewind.ai alike timeline powered by a single html file :) that you can tweak around!

## 1. installation options

### cli installation

- **for technical users**: screenpipe can be installed and used via the command-line interface (cli).
- **instructions**:
  1. clone the repository.
  2. install dependencies (ensure rust, cargo, and any other required tools are installed).
  3. build the project and run the cli.

</MotionDiv>

### desktop app

- **paid desktop app**: offers priority support, 1-year updates, and exclusive features. users can download and install the desktop app directly from the official site.
- **free desktop app**: open-source and available to build yourself. installation requires building from the source code or sending a pr to the repository. both options provide a fully functional desktop application with all key features.

</MotionDiv>

### manual build

for users preferring full control or customization, building the app manually from the repository is an option. this method requires rust and other necessary dependencies. follow the provided build guide to compile the app.

## macos installation

<MotionDiv delay={1.2}>

### **option 1: build from source (for advanced users)**

1. start by installing rust and all necessary dependencies:
   ```bash copy
   curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh
   brew install pkg-config ffmpeg jq cmake wget
   ```

2. install bun cli (required for building):
   ```bash copy
   curl -fsSL https://bun.sh/install | bash
   ```

3. clone the screenpipe repository:
   ```bash copy
   git clone https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe
   cd screenpipe
   ```

4. build the project with:
   ```bash copy
   cargo build --release --features metal
   ```

5. finally, run screenpipe:
   ```bash copy
   ./target/release/screenpipe
   ```


add this to your vscode settings in the root of the project `.vscode/settings.json`:

```json copy
{
   "rust-analyzer.cargo.features": [
      "metal",
      "pipes"
   ],
   "rust-analyzer.server.extraEnv": {
      "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}",
      "SCREENPIPE_APP_DEV": "true"
   },
   "rust-analyzer.cargo.extraEnv": {
      "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}",
      "SCREENPIPE_APP_DEV": "true"
   },
   "terminal.integrated.env.osx": {
      "DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH": "${workspaceFolder}/screenpipe-vision/lib:${env:DYLD_LIBRARY_PATH}",
      "SCREENPIPE_APP_DEV": "true"
   }
}
```

```bash copy
cd screenpipe-app-tauri
bun install
bun scripts/pre_build.js # <- this is important to copy the CLI into the app
bun tauri build
```

## windows installation (experimental)

<MotionDiv delay={1.7}>

### **steps to install on windows**

> This is experimental support for Windows build. This assumes you already have the CUDA Toolkit installed and the CUDA_PATH set to my CUDA v12.6 folder.
> Replace `V:\projects` and `V:\packages` with your own folders.

If this does not work for you, please [open an issue](https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/issues/new?assignees=&labels=dislike&template=dislike.yml&title=windows+install+screenpipe+didnt+work) or get the pre-built [desktop app](https://screenpi.pe)

Install 7zip: https://www.7-zip.org/download.html

```batch copy
choco install pkgconfiglite bun

### troubleshooting

- facing any key signing issues? you need to [sign the build for the updater then](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/#signing-updates)

### important note for developers

if you encounter key-related errors when building from source, especially for the desktop app, you may need to sign your updates. this is particularly important for our production builds and ensuring secure update processes.

for detailed instructions on signing updates, please refer to the [tauri updater documentation](https://v2.tauri.app/plugin/updater/#signing-updates).

you can probably remove the updater config in your fork if you don't need it.

</MotionDiv>

### other options 

- check this [docker setup](https://github.com/sabrehagen/desktop-environment/blob/d273442143260b414c581d7a53be0618ca822bc0/docker/Dockerfile#L409-L421)
- use 
```bash copy
export CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_LTO=true
export CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_OPT_LEVEL=z
export CARGO_PROFILE_RELEASE_CODEGEN_UNITS=1
``` 
to build a faster and smaller release but takes longer to build

## for businesses 

you can use screenpipe in your business either by:
- running the CLI on your customer's computer
- running the app on your customer's computer
- embedding the library or CLI in your own software
- running the CLI in the cloud and forward the video/audio through SSH
