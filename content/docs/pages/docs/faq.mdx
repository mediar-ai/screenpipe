  <summary>How do I manage screenpipe sessions?</summary>
  
  - **starting a session**: 
    - macOS: use the system tray icon or run `screenpipe` in terminal
    - windows: launch from start menu or run `screenpipe` in command prompt
    - linux: run `screenpipe` in terminal
  
  - **checking if session is running**:
    ```bash
    curl localhost:3030/health
    # If running, you'll get a health status response
    # If not running, you'll get a connection refused error
    ```
  
  - **stopping a session**:
    - macOS: cmd+option+x or right-click tray icon and select "quit"
    - windows: right-click tray icon and select "exit"
    - linux: ctrl+c in terminal
    
  - **troubleshooting**:
    - if ctrl+c doesn't work to stop a terminal session, try:
      ```bash
      # Find screenpipe process ID
      ps aux | grep screenpipe
      # Kill the process
      kill -9 [PID]
      ```
    - if the server starts but API calls fail, check if another instance is already running
