# plugins (pipes)

<MotionDiv>
  screenpipe is built for extensibility through plugins that interact with captured screen and audio data. whether you need to tag activities, generate summaries, or send data to third-party services, plugins let you build powerful workflows.

  plugins run within screenpipe's sandboxed environment. written in typescript/javascript and nextjs.

### why build pipes? ðŸš€

<MotionDiv delay={0.3}>
agents are quite dumb without context. screenpipe is the bridge between human context and AI understanding.

#### for developers
- **zero infrastructure**: run locally, no servers or complex setups, access to your auth tokens (unlike cloud agents)
- **typescript + rust + bun**: blazing fast environment
- **full context**: rich OCR, desktop scrapping, keyboard/mouse, and audio transcription APIs
- **open source**: contribute to augmenting collective human intelligence
- **monetization ready**: Stripe integration to monetize your pipes
- **no lock-in**: ship a startup in 1h in screenpipe's store and export it later as a desktop native app using screenpipe as a library (we will even help you with that)

#### killer features
- **ai flexibility**: OpenAI, local LLMs (ollama), Anthropic, Gemini, etc.
- **rich APIs**: 
  - `pipe.input` for keyboard/mouse control
  - `pipe.queryScreenpipe` for context
  - `pipe.settings` for app settings
  - experimental `pipe.streamTranscriptions` for audio transcription streaming (atm uses a lot of RAM, make sure to enable it in settings/CLI)
  - experimental `pipe.streamVision` for OCR/Accessibility streaming (atm uses a lot of RAM)
- **sandboxed & cross-platform**: safe execution on all OS
- **real-time**: process screen & audio as it happens
- **cron jobs**: schedule your pipes to run at specific times, same API as Vercel
- **nextjs**: build desktop native apps with NextJS - no native hell

### quick start

<MotionDiv delay={0.5}>

The fastest way to create a new pipe is using our CLI:

<Tabs items={['bun', 'npm', , 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bunx @screenpipe/create-pipe@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npx @screenpipe/create-pipe@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn @screenpipe/create-pipe
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpx @screenpipe/create-pipe
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

follow installation instructions & test your pipe locally

```bash copy
bun dev
```

### developer CLI

for developers wanting to publish pipes to the store, we provide a dedicated CLI tool:

![developer account](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/main/content/developer-account.png)

prerequisite: connect your Stripe account in settings/account to obtain your developer API key.

available commands:

```bash copy
# authenticate with your API key
bunx @screenpipe/dev login --apiKey <your-key>

# create a new pipe
bunx @screenpipe/dev create --name my-pipe [--paid --price 9.99] # MAKE SURE TO SET THE PRICE IF YOU WANT TO SELL IT - IRREVERSIBLE
# you'll receive payouts to your stripe account on a daily basis

# publish your pipe to the store
bunx @screenpipe/dev publish --name my-pipe
# our team will review your pipe and publish it to the store
# if approved, your pipe will be available in the store to everyone

# list all versions of your pipe
bunx @screenpipe/dev list-versions --name my-pipe

# end current session
bunx @screenpipe/dev logout
```

you can deploy your pipe to your screenpipe app through the UI or using `screenpipe install <path>` and `screenpipe enable <id/folder of your pipe>`.

when you're ready to deploy, send a PR to the [screenpipe repo](https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe) to add your pipe to the store.
