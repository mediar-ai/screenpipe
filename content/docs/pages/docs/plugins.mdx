# plugins (pipes)

<MotionDiv>
  screenpipe is built for extensibility through plugins that interact with captured screen and audio data. whether you need to tag activities, generate summaries, or send data to third-party services, plugins let you build powerful workflows.

  plugins come in two flavors:
  - **pipes**: native plugins that run within screenpipe's sandboxed environment. written in typescript/javascript. pipes can be either:
    - UI-based: with NextJS for user interaction (e.g. think of screenpipe as a local Vercel powered by your 24/7 context)
    - Headless: running in the background without a visual interface with cron, etc.
</MotionDiv>

### why build pipes? ðŸš€

<MotionDiv delay={0.3}>
think of pipes like a local Zapier which costs 10x & 10x less friction - no auth needed, with full context of your screen and audio data.

#### for developers
- **zero infrastructure**: run locally, no servers or complex setups, access to your auth tokens (unlike Zapier)
- **typescript + bun**: blazing fast development
- **full context**: rich OCR, desktop scrapping, keyboard/mouse, and audio transcription APIs
- **monetization ready**: Stripe integration to monetize your pipes
- **bounty program**: earn $100+ for building pipes or promoting screenpipe
- **open source**: contribute to augmenting collective human intelligence

#### killer features
- **ai flexibility**: OpenAI, local LLMs (ollama), or any provider
- **rich APIs**: 
  - `pipe.inbox` for AI/human-in-the-loop messaging
  - `pipe.scheduler` for cron jobs
  - `pipe.input` for keyboard/mouse control
  - `pipe.queryScreenpipe` for context
- **sandboxed & cross-platform**: safe execution on all OS
- **real-time**: process screen & audio as it happens

### quick start

<MotionDiv delay={0.5}>

The fastest way to create a new pipe is using our CLI:

<Tabs items={['bun', 'npm', , 'yarn', 'pnpm']}>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    bunx @screenpipe/create-pipe@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    npx @screenpipe/create-pipe@latest
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    yarn @screenpipe/create-pipe
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab>
    ```bash copy
    pnpx @screenpipe/create-pipe
    ```
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

follow installation instructions & test your pipe locally

then enable your pipe in screenpipe

```bash copy
screenpipe pipe enable my-pipe
```

the CLI will guide you through setting up your pipe

### available pipes

| **pipe**                          | **description**                                  | **link**                          |

</MotionDiv>

to install a pipe from the store, just add the url of the folder in the UI and click install.

in CLI:

```bash copy
screenpipe pipe download https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/tree/main/pipes/pipe-obsidian-time-logs
screenpipe pipe enable pipe-obsidian-time-logs
```

### pipe configuration

<MotionDiv delay={0.7}>

we use `pipe.json` to configure your pipe through UI/CLI:

```json
{
  "fields": [
    {
      "default": 60,
      "description": "Interval in seconds to process screen data",
      "name": "interval",
      "type": "number"
    },
    {
      "default": "daily",
      "description": "Summary frequency: 'daily' or 'hourly:X'",
      "name": "summaryFrequency",
      "type": "string"
    }
  ]
}
```

this will render in the screenpipe UI.

### screenpipe-js SDK

key features:
- `pipe.inbox.send`: AI messages with user confirmation
- `pipe.sendDesktopNotification`: system notifications
- `pipe.queryScreenpipe`: query screen/audio data
- `pipe.scheduler`: cron-like scheduling
- `pipe.input`: programmatic UI control
- (experimental) [vercel-like crons](https://vercel.com/docs/cron-jobs/manage-cron-jobs) - just replace `vercel.json` by `pipe.json` (only work for nextjs pipes)
