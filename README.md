Turn your screen into actions (using LLMs). Inspired by `adept.ai`, `rewind.ai`, `Apple Shortcut`. Rust + WASM.

## Screen to action using LLMs
Here's an example of server-side code written in TypeScript that takes the streamed data from ScreenPipe and uses a Large Language Model like OpenAI's to process text and images for analyzing sales conversations:

```typescript
import { ScreenPipe } from "screenpipe";
import { generateObject } from 'ai';
import { z } from 'zod';

const screenPipe = new ScreenPipe();

export async function onTick() {
  const data = await screenPipe.tick([1], {frames: 60}); // or screen [1, 2, 3, ...]
  // [{frame: [...], text: [...], metadata: [...]}, ...]

  const { object } = await generateObject({
    model: openai("gpt4-o"),
    schema: z.object({
      leads: z.array(z.object({
        name: z.string(),
        company: z.string(),
        role: z.string(),
        status: z.string(),
        messages: z.array(z.string()),
      }),
    })),
    prompt: "Fill salesforce CRM based on Bob's sales activity (this is what appeared on his screen): " +
     data.map((frame) => frame.text).join("\n"),
  });

  // Add to Salesforce API ...
}
```

## Status 

Alpha: runs on my computer. Capture things and do things.


## Usage

Keep in mind that it's still experimental but got a working prototype, see the [Related projects](#related-projects) section.

To try the current version, which capture your screen and extract the text, run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/louis030195/screen-pipe
cd screen-pipe
```

Then, in one terminal run the OCR API [(just a temporary hack until something cleaner)](https://github.com/louis030195/screen-pipe/issues/7):

```bash
virtualenv env
source env/bin/activate
pip install fastapi uvicorn pytesseract pillow
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

And (you need Rust + Cargo installed) the Rust CLI:

```bash
cargo install --path screenpipe
screenpipe
```

Check the `target/screenshots` directory now :)

## Why open source?

Recent breakthroughs in AI have shown that context is the final frontier. AI will soon be able to incorporate the context of an entire human life into its 'prompt', and the technologies that enable this kind of personalisation should be available to all developers to accelerate access to the next stage of our evolution.
