# Why?

Building a reliable stream of audio and screenshot data, where a user simply clicks a button and the script runs in the background 24/7, collecting and extracting data from screen and audio input/output, can be frustrating. 

There are numerous use cases that can be built on top of this layer. To simplify life for other developers, we decided to solve this non-trivial problem. It's still in its early stages, but it works end-to-end. We're working on this full-time and would love to hear your feedback and suggestions.

## Get started

There are multiple ways to install screenpipe:
- as a CLI for technical users
- as a [paid desktop app](https://screenpi.pe/onboarding) with 1 year updates, priority support, and priority features
- as a free forever desktop app (but you need to build it yourself). We're 100% OSS.
- get the desktop app 1 year license by sending a PR ([example](https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/issues/120#issuecomment-2275043418)) or [sharing about screenpipe online](https://screenpi.pe/onboarding/free-community)
- as a Rust or WASM library - check this [websocket](https://github.com/mediar-ai/screenpipe/blob/main/screenpipe-vision/examples/websocket.rs) to stream frames + OCR to your app
- [as a business](https://cal.com/louis030195/screenpipe-for-businesses) 

[**üëâ install screenpipe now**](https://docs.screenpi.pe/docs/getting-started)
