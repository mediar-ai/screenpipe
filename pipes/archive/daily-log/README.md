this is quite experimental but a good start if you want to build a daily log of your day


feel free to prompt engineer, works with ollama, openai.

openai works better obviously

make sure to keep the prompt not too big for the LLM (time interval 1-5 min)

### usage

```
pnpm i # or npm i
export OPENAI_API_KEY="<your key>"
# or modify the code to use llama3.1 through ollama (just two lines to uncomment & comment)
npx tsx main.ts
```
