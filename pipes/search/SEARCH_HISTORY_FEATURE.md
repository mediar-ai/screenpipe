  searchParams: {
    q?: string;
    content_type: string;
    limit: number;
    offset: number;
    start_time: string;
    end_time: string;
    app_name?: string;
    window_name?: string;
    include_frames: boolean;
    min_length: number;
    max_length: number;
  };
  results: ContentItem[];
  messages: {
    id: string;
    type: 'search' | 'ai';
    content: string;
    timestamp: string;
  }[];
}
```

## Usage

### Opening the Sidebar
- Click the sidebar trigger button (hamburger menu) in the top-left corner
- On mobile, this opens a slide-out sheet
- On desktop, this toggles a collapsible sidebar

### Saving Searches
- Searches are automatically saved when you execute a query
- Only non-empty queries are saved to keep history clean
- Each search includes all parameters and results

### Restoring Searches
1. Open the search history sidebar
2. Browse through time-grouped searches
3. Click on any search to restore it completely
4. The search will restore query, parameters, results, and AI messages

### Managing History
- Hover over any search item to see the delete button
- Click the delete button to remove a search from history
- The sidebar footer shows the total number of saved searches

## Browser Compatibility

- **Storage**: Uses IndexedDB via localforage (supports all modern browsers)
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- **Animations**: Uses framer-motion for smooth transitions
- **Accessibility**: Full keyboard navigation and screen reader support

## Performance Considerations

- **Lazy Loading**: Search results are stored locally, no re-querying needed
- **Efficient Storage**: Uses IndexedDB for large data storage
- **Memory Management**: Only loads visible search items
- **Debounced Operations**: Search operations are optimized to prevent spam

## Future Enhancements

- **Search within History**: Add ability to search through saved searches
- **Export/Import**: Allow users to backup and restore their search history
- **Search Categories**: Add ability to organize searches into categories
- **Shared History**: Sync search history across devices (with user consent)
- **Advanced Filters**: Filter history by date range, content type, etc.

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure the SidebarProvider is properly wrapped around the component
- Check browser console for any JavaScript errors
- Verify that all required dependencies are installed

### Search Not Saving
- Check browser's IndexedDB support and storage permissions
- Ensure queries are non-empty (empty queries are not saved)
- Check browser console for storage-related errors

### Mobile Issues

- Ensure proper viewport meta tag is set
- Test on actual mobile devices for best results
