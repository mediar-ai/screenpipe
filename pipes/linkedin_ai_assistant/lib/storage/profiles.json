Lammis was as lovable and soft as the candies Isabeli adored so much. With its rainbow-colored heart 💖 and fluffy white fur, Lammis looked like the sweetest dream made of cotton candy.",
        "Lammis and Isabeli quickly became friends 👭 and spent their days playing hide and seek among the clouds ☁️ and sharing secret treasures 💎. Lammis showed her that there was more magic in the world than just candy, and Isabeli taught Lammis to enjoy the small joys, like finding the perfect sweet treat 🍡.",
        "Every day at sunset 🌅, they said goodbye at the edge of the forest, and Isabeli went home with pockets full of sweet memories 🍭 and a heart as filled with joy as Lammis's rainbow heart. And so they lived happily in a world where friendship was the sweetest gift of all 🌍💞.",

We need to heal the industry by using the most modern tools in the right order, knowing that we are building a scalable, modular foundation for future generations to build on. Highlight the importance of democratization and acceleration of AI-infused smart buildings and that we need to make buildings intelligent, self-learning, and self-optimizing. Not just make vendors and applications smarter, adding to the thousand-cuts problem in the industry. The lifecycle aspects need to be bigger, and how it should result in buildings that are more robust, useful, and attractive while catering to the 3/30/300 rule and making a profit where the future is all about transparent, secure, modern buildings that can be transacted through a blockchain marketplace, delivering tailor-made value in the speed of seconds. And that Digital Twins are a paramount technology to deliver this value in record time, enabling extreme collaboration and concurrent engineering approaches to take place, where virtual-first strategies will allow us to reduce risk, create sustainable simulations based on an emulated reality, where we can use metaversal mastery to not only escape reality but to improve it based on a planetary purpose.",

        "At the SK AI Summit 2024, held in Seoul on November 4th, Mr. Tae-won (Tony) Chey, Chairman and CEO of SK Group (revenue $158B), emphasized the importance of building an AI ecosystem through collaboration. The event’s slogan, “AI Together, AI Tomorrow,” underscored this collaborative vision as Mr. Chey highlighted SK’s partnerships with NVIDIA, TSMC, OpenAI, Microsoft, and other key players. He addressed major AI bottlenecks—use cases, GPU, energy, and data —and shared how SK’s partnerships are working to overcome these challenges. Following Mr. Chey’s opening remarks, Greg Brockman, President of OpenAI, delivered the keynote address. Additional presentations from SK Telecom CEO Mr. Young Sang Ryu and SK hynix CEO Mr. Noh-Jung Kwak detailed their respective AI strategies. Several speakers also focused on AI infrastructure, particularly emphasizing the crucial roles of power, cooling, and chips, as well as the importance of inference AI once training is complete. Notably, Cleveland Avenue portfolio companies NeuReality (a disruptive innovator in AI inference compute and network infrastructure) and Eliyan Corporation (highest-performance and most efficient chiplet interconnect) are actively working on solutions to these needs. It was also a pleasure to connect with a familiar face, Stephen Choi, CEO of ViFive, at the event.",

        "The best emerging funds we’ve invested in scaled their fund sizes relatively quickly on the backs of early successes. In the emerging manager category, getting in early as an LP earns you the privilege of investing in subsequent funds managed by GPs with a proven track record. Given the outperformance of top-tier emerging managers versus bigger VCs in the past decade, investing early offers the potential for superior fund returns AND optionality for co-investment in the follow-on rounds of outliers. At MDSV, we help LPs with early and continued access to the best EMFs in the market. Find out more: https://lnkd.in/gG6X5bZt #EmergingManagerFunds #MDSVCapital #InvestInVC",

        "Had a terrific time at last month’s RAISE conference in San Francisco which highlighted the level of LP interest in emerging managers. We had excellent conversations with GPs like Martin Tobias, Jenny He, Itamar Novick and Chad Anderson who are backing the outliers of tomorrow. It was also good to connect with so many LPs like Steve Kim, Erick Gorodezky, James Danforth, Chris Douvos and Miles Deamer who, like us, are recognizing the need for venture to return to its roots of early-stage investing via focused managers whose incentives are aligned with LPs. Emerging managers have been the greatest source of alpha in venture over the past two decades, and the packed conference showcased the vibrancy of this category. Thanks to the RAISE Global organizers for a great event. #RaiseConference #RaiseGlobal #SanFrancisco #EmergingManagers",

        "Life is for sharing and for the next two decades, I commit to use the collective wisdom of an army of gracious mentors, advisors, leaders, managers, colleagues, and friends to share with the next generation of entrepreneurs. I am certain they will use life’s wisdom & technology innovation to further change the world for the better.",
        "I boarded a flight from Germany to Silicon Valley for a one-year stay on Sept 8th, 1991 and what a fantastic journey it has been - and still is.",
        "I will not be able to name all the people who have influenced me and became a part of my life, some for almost 30 years, but I am certain you all know whom I am grateful for. The only person I will name is my beautiful wife and mother of two extraordinary teenagers,",

        "who after 23 years of marriage, still reminds me daily what life is about – family and helping others.",

        "For the next decades, I will further follow my passion to evangelize innovation, use technology to solve real customer problems, enable developers and support the next generation of entrepreneurs, and further strengthen the transatlantic relationships.",
        "Maybe one regret: It took me way too long to internalize the wisdom that was already shared with me all these past years. Humans have two big ears and one small mouth – listen more and speak less 😉",
        "Thank you all and feel free to share.",

        "During my 20+ year career in technology services for multinational, industry-leading companies, I deliberately sought out the most challenging assignments so I could deliver faster, better, and more cost-efficient IT services to staff and customers. I refuse to settle for the status quo and have enthusiastically provided the leadership needed to bring about significant cost reductions through process automation, shared services, mobile technology, and centralization/consolidation of services.",
        "Over the course of several years at Guardian Life, I systematically built strategic partnerships with business leaders and C-suite executives that enabled me to leverage the disruption of acquisitions, divestitures, and multiple office relocations into opportunities to achieve long-lasting improvements in services and processes. For example, I developed a solid business plan and then collaborated with senior executives across 8 disparate organizations to consolidate all service desks, creating a “center of excellence” that saves the company approximately $500K/year and consistently achieves a first call resolution rates of 78%-80% and customer satisfaction rates of 9.5+% (out of 10).",
        "In addition to making investments in technology, I have always taken advantage of opportunities to develop staff and teams. I am passionate about cultivating in-house skills and fostering leadership skills. By cross-training employees and developing expertise, I have reduced our reliance on outside services including Microsoft.",

I helped create an organized and cost-efficient operation with well-documented policies, optimal workflows, and exceptional talent, and my contributions resulted in significant cost savings and quantifiable increases in efficiency without any additional budgetary spend.",

We just launched “First Listens” which enables artists to drop music ahead of wider releases to their communities on Medallion. One of our first artists who activated the feature saw the following results within 24 hours: 🚀 70 % growth in community size (thousands of new members) 🚀 50% of total members listened to the track 🚀 13% of total members commented / actively engaged with the track Nurturing your fanbase is the first step to unlocking the super fan economy. Fans in the Medallion powered communities are more leaned in and more valuable than any where else. Excited for more of our amazing artist partners to fully use First Listens to grow and and engage their fans!! (shoutout to Samantha Sachs & wider Columbia Records team on the below!)",

Events were a key component of the program and a critical way for us to engage with our customers, and Jitter was instrumental in shaping that part of the experience for our subscribers. The core team was small, and there were high expectations to deliver 3 - 4 quality national events a month through the program. We relied heavily on Jitter to lead the vision, management, and execution of all of those. Her dedication to creating on-brand experiences and her great eye for detail ensured each part of the event, from choice of paper for the programs to relationship management with guests, was covered. What impressed me most about Jitter was that she proactively sought feedback and was open to doing things differently or trying new things in order to continue developing her skills or improve her output. This positive attitude is essential to achieving her highest potential, and I have no doubt she will succeed in whatever she sets her mind to. Lastly, Jitter was a ton of fun to work with and I always enjoyed spending time with her in and out of work. I'd definitely be happy to work with her again.",

The project sought to merge design and fabrication processes, drawing from spider threads' biomimetic strength and structure. 🕸️ The printer utilizes a unique spindle-knot extrusion technique, enabling self-supporting structures and greater spatial flexibility than traditional layer-based 3D printing. The device features a robot from KUKA and a robotic end-effector with movable printheads, controlled by an Arduino-based system with precise temperature and extrusion controls.

        "Thrilled to have participated in the panel \"Innovations in Finance: Exploring the Next Frontier\" during @Hong Kong FinTech Week earlier today! The panel touched on many interesting topics and I mentioned that, as a marketplace operator, HKEX always considers the whole ecosystem and discusses with all our stakeholders when looking into new technologies. That’s something that is also very important for startups and founders to focus on, as they need to see the broader picture and bring everyone along for the journey to make sure their innovations will succeed. Success in technology innovation takes time, patience and active listening and our ODP derivatives platform is a great example of that, as it involved extensive consultations and participation from critical players. On the regulatory front, we also discussed how it's crucial to balance promoting innovation and maintaining market quality. AI is and will continue to be a big focus for the financial services sector, but I think more importantly will be to focus on talent and supporting people to make decisions for the greater good. While AI has potential and will be present in our daily lives, it's crucial to conscientiously foster human creativity and decision-making. Lastly, big shoutout to HKEX data team for launch of Virtual Asset Index Series https://lnkd.in/gtmmzVxg today at HK Fintech Week #HKFTW24 #Innovation #Finance #Regulation #AI",

However, I was especially appreciative of Georgeo's background and expertise last spring when an employee was caught in the Ukraine days after Russia invaded. I worked with Georgeo and his team and our Duty of Care provider to track and support our employee's trek through the Ukraine to safety into Romania. Georgeo's depth of knowledge and resources, although ultimately not utilized, provided knowlege and comfort during an extremely stressful situation. Georgeo is personable, knowledgable and a pleasure to partner with!",

Inna is very goal-oriented, energetic, active and extremely, I would even say, fantastically good at getting things done. Here I mean not only the projects initiated and driven by her or her department, but even those that were \"hanging in the air\" for months or even years before she took the responsibility for them. Apart from that Inna is quite strong in the cross-disciplinary projects, say, the ones on the border of HR and IT, HR and PR. Resuming what I have said above, I would strongly recommend Inna for the Project Management or HR Project Management roles in the international or Russia companies in the need of the professionals with driving force and outstanding level of energy.",
