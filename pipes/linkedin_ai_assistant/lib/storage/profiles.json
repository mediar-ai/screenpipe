Lammis was as lovable and soft as the candies Isabeli adored so much. With its rainbow-colored heart 💖 and fluffy white fur, Lammis looked like the sweetest dream made of cotton candy.",
        "Lammis and Isabeli quickly became friends 👭 and spent their days playing hide and seek among the clouds ☁️ and sharing secret treasures 💎. Lammis showed her that there was more magic in the world than just candy, and Isabeli taught Lammis to enjoy the small joys, like finding the perfect sweet treat 🍡.",
        "Every day at sunset 🌅, they said goodbye at the edge of the forest, and Isabeli went home with pockets full of sweet memories 🍭 and a heart as filled with joy as Lammis's rainbow heart. And so they lived happily in a world where friendship was the sweetest gift of all 🌍💞.",

We need to heal the industry by using the most modern tools in the right order, knowing that we are building a scalable, modular foundation for future generations to build on. Highlight the importance of democratization and acceleration of AI-infused smart buildings and that we need to make buildings intelligent, self-learning, and self-optimizing. Not just make vendors and applications smarter, adding to the thousand-cuts problem in the industry. The lifecycle aspects need to be bigger, and how it should result in buildings that are more robust, useful, and attractive while catering to the 3/30/300 rule and making a profit where the future is all about transparent, secure, modern buildings that can be transacted through a blockchain marketplace, delivering tailor-made value in the speed of seconds. And that Digital Twins are a paramount technology to deliver this value in record time, enabling extreme collaboration and concurrent engineering approaches to take place, where virtual-first strategies will allow us to reduce risk, create sustainable simulations based on an emulated reality, where we can use metaversal mastery to not only escape reality but to improve it based on a planetary purpose.",

        "At the SK AI Summit 2024, held in Seoul on November 4th, Mr. Tae-won (Tony) Chey, Chairman and CEO of SK Group (revenue $158B), emphasized the importance of building an AI ecosystem through collaboration. The event’s slogan, “AI Together, AI Tomorrow,” underscored this collaborative vision as Mr. Chey highlighted SK’s partnerships with NVIDIA, TSMC, OpenAI, Microsoft, and other key players. He addressed major AI bottlenecks—use cases, GPU, energy, and data —and shared how SK’s partnerships are working to overcome these challenges. Following Mr. Chey’s opening remarks, Greg Brockman, President of OpenAI, delivered the keynote address. Additional presentations from SK Telecom CEO Mr. Young Sang Ryu and SK hynix CEO Mr. Noh-Jung Kwak detailed their respective AI strategies. Several speakers also focused on AI infrastructure, particularly emphasizing the crucial roles of power, cooling, and chips, as well as the importance of inference AI once training is complete. Notably, Cleveland Avenue portfolio companies NeuReality (a disruptive innovator in AI inference compute and network infrastructure) and Eliyan Corporation (highest-performance and most efficient chiplet interconnect) are actively working on solutions to these needs. It was also a pleasure to connect with a familiar face, Stephen Choi, CEO of ViFive, at the event.",

        "The best emerging funds we’ve invested in scaled their fund sizes relatively quickly on the backs of early successes. In the emerging manager category, getting in early as an LP earns you the privilege of investing in subsequent funds managed by GPs with a proven track record. Given the outperformance of top-tier emerging managers versus bigger VCs in the past decade, investing early offers the potential for superior fund returns AND optionality for co-investment in the follow-on rounds of outliers. At MDSV, we help LPs with early and continued access to the best EMFs in the market. Find out more: https://lnkd.in/gG6X5bZt #EmergingManagerFunds #MDSVCapital #InvestInVC",

        "Had a terrific time at last month’s RAISE conference in San Francisco which highlighted the level of LP interest in emerging managers. We had excellent conversations with GPs like Martin Tobias, Jenny He, Itamar Novick and Chad Anderson who are backing the outliers of tomorrow. It was also good to connect with so many LPs like Steve Kim, Erick Gorodezky, James Danforth, Chris Douvos and Miles Deamer who, like us, are recognizing the need for venture to return to its roots of early-stage investing via focused managers whose incentives are aligned with LPs. Emerging managers have been the greatest source of alpha in venture over the past two decades, and the packed conference showcased the vibrancy of this category. Thanks to the RAISE Global organizers for a great event. #RaiseConference #RaiseGlobal #SanFrancisco #EmergingManagers",

        "Life is for sharing and for the next two decades, I commit to use the collective wisdom of an army of gracious mentors, advisors, leaders, managers, colleagues, and friends to share with the next generation of entrepreneurs. I am certain they will use life’s wisdom & technology innovation to further change the world for the better.",
        "I boarded a flight from Germany to Silicon Valley for a one-year stay on Sept 8th, 1991 and what a fantastic journey it has been - and still is.",
        "I will not be able to name all the people who have influenced me and became a part of my life, some for almost 30 years, but I am certain you all know whom I am grateful for. The only person I will name is my beautiful wife and mother of two extraordinary teenagers,",

        "who after 23 years of marriage, still reminds me daily what life is about – family and helping others.",

        "For the next decades, I will further follow my passion to evangelize innovation, use technology to solve real customer problems, enable developers and support the next generation of entrepreneurs, and further strengthen the transatlantic relationships.",
        "Maybe one regret: It took me way too long to internalize the wisdom that was already shared with me all these past years. Humans have two big ears and one small mouth – listen more and speak less 😉",
        "Thank you all and feel free to share.",

        "During my 20+ year career in technology services for multinational, industry-leading companies, I deliberately sought out the most challenging assignments so I could deliver faster, better, and more cost-efficient IT services to staff and customers. I refuse to settle for the status quo and have enthusiastically provided the leadership needed to bring about significant cost reductions through process automation, shared services, mobile technology, and centralization/consolidation of services.",
        "Over the course of several years at Guardian Life, I systematically built strategic partnerships with business leaders and C-suite executives that enabled me to leverage the disruption of acquisitions, divestitures, and multiple office relocations into opportunities to achieve long-lasting improvements in services and processes. For example, I developed a solid business plan and then collaborated with senior executives across 8 disparate organizations to consolidate all service desks, creating a “center of excellence” that saves the company approximately $500K/year and consistently achieves a first call resolution rates of 78%-80% and customer satisfaction rates of 9.5+% (out of 10).",
        "In addition to making investments in technology, I have always taken advantage of opportunities to develop staff and teams. I am passionate about cultivating in-house skills and fostering leadership skills. By cross-training employees and developing expertise, I have reduced our reliance on outside services including Microsoft.",

I helped create an organized and cost-efficient operation with well-documented policies, optimal workflows, and exceptional talent, and my contributions resulted in significant cost savings and quantifiable increases in efficiency without any additional budgetary spend.",

We just launched “First Listens” which enables artists to drop music ahead of wider releases to their communities on Medallion. One of our first artists who activated the feature saw the following results within 24 hours: 🚀 70 % growth in community size (thousands of new members) 🚀 50% of total members listened to the track 🚀 13% of total members commented / actively engaged with the track Nurturing your fanbase is the first step to unlocking the super fan economy. Fans in the Medallion powered communities are more leaned in and more valuable than any where else. Excited for more of our amazing artist partners to fully use First Listens to grow and and engage their fans!! (shoutout to Samantha Sachs & wider Columbia Records team on the below!)",

Events were a key component of the program and a critical way for us to engage with our customers, and Jitter was instrumental in shaping that part of the experience for our subscribers. The core team was small, and there were high expectations to deliver 3 - 4 quality national events a month through the program. We relied heavily on Jitter to lead the vision, management, and execution of all of those. Her dedication to creating on-brand experiences and her great eye for detail ensured each part of the event, from choice of paper for the programs to relationship management with guests, was covered. What impressed me most about Jitter was that she proactively sought feedback and was open to doing things differently or trying new things in order to continue developing her skills or improve her output. This positive attitude is essential to achieving her highest potential, and I have no doubt she will succeed in whatever she sets her mind to. Lastly, Jitter was a ton of fun to work with and I always enjoyed spending time with her in and out of work. I'd definitely be happy to work with her again.",

The project sought to merge design and fabrication processes, drawing from spider threads' biomimetic strength and structure. 🕸️ The printer utilizes a unique spindle-knot extrusion technique, enabling self-supporting structures and greater spatial flexibility than traditional layer-based 3D printing. The device features a robot from KUKA and a robotic end-effector with movable printheads, controlled by an Arduino-based system with precise temperature and extrusion controls.

        "Thrilled to have participated in the panel \"Innovations in Finance: Exploring the Next Frontier\" during @Hong Kong FinTech Week earlier today! The panel touched on many interesting topics and I mentioned that, as a marketplace operator, HKEX always considers the whole ecosystem and discusses with all our stakeholders when looking into new technologies. That’s something that is also very important for startups and founders to focus on, as they need to see the broader picture and bring everyone along for the journey to make sure their innovations will succeed. Success in technology innovation takes time, patience and active listening and our ODP derivatives platform is a great example of that, as it involved extensive consultations and participation from critical players. On the regulatory front, we also discussed how it's crucial to balance promoting innovation and maintaining market quality. AI is and will continue to be a big focus for the financial services sector, but I think more importantly will be to focus on talent and supporting people to make decisions for the greater good. While AI has potential and will be present in our daily lives, it's crucial to conscientiously foster human creativity and decision-making. Lastly, big shoutout to HKEX data team for launch of Virtual Asset Index Series https://lnkd.in/gtmmzVxg today at HK Fintech Week #HKFTW24 #Innovation #Finance #Regulation #AI",

Inna is very goal-oriented, energetic, active and extremely, I would even say, fantastically good at getting things done. Here I mean not only the projects initiated and driven by her or her department, but even those that were \"hanging in the air\" for months or even years before she took the responsibility for them. Apart from that Inna is quite strong in the cross-disciplinary projects, say, the ones on the border of HR and IT, HR and PR. Resuming what I have said above, I would strongly recommend Inna for the Project Management or HR Project Management roles in the international or Russia companies in the need of the professionals with driving force and outstanding level of energy.",

        "🎓📆 Attention anyone with college-bound students! The FAFSA deadline is approaching, and you don't want to miss out on your chance to apply for financial aid for the upcoming academic year. Here are some tips to keep in mind: ➡️ The deadline is June 30, 2024, but many states and colleges have earlier deadlines. Check with your state and the schools you're interested in. ⏰ ➡️ Before starting, collect all the necessary information, such as your most recent bank statements. This may help make the process smoother. 📑 ➡️ Some financial aid is awarded on a first-come, first-served basis, so submitting your FAFSA as soon as possible can increase your chances. 🏃‍♂️ ➡️ You might qualify! If you think your family's income is too high, fill out the FAFSA anyway. You may be surprised to find out you're eligible for some form of financial aid. 🙌 If you have questions or need assistance completing your FAFSA, contact your school's financial aid office, attend a FAFSA workshop, or visit the official FAFSA website for resources and support. And feel free to reach out to us if you have any other general questions about college funding! #FAFSA #FinancialAid #CollegeBound #HigherEducation",

        "Anyone have a daughter or son who is starting a summer job? 💡 Idea – Have you opened a Roth IRA for them? As many know, Roth IRA contributions are made with after-tax dollars, so your child will only pay taxes (and perhaps penalties) once they make withdrawals. What you may not realize is how flexible they are: ✅ Your child can withdraw up to the amount of their total contributions at any time, for any reason, without paying taxes or penalties. However, you may have to pay taxes and penalties on any earnings. ✅ They can also withdraw contributions before 59½ and before the account is five years old for the following (keep in mind that you may be able to avoid penalties but not taxes): - Funds can be used for qualified higher education expenses. 🎓 - First-time home purchase (up to a $10,000 lifetime limit.) - If your child becomes disabled. ♿ - For certain emergency expenses. 🏥 - If your child is unemployed, they can use a withdrawal to help pay for health insurance premiums. 🩺 ✅ Things to know: - Your child must have earned income to contribute to a Roth IRA. - You can open a Roth IRA for your child and manage it until they reach the age of majority in your state. - The maximum contribution for 2024 is $7,000 or the total of their earned income, whichever is less. Opening a Roth IRA for your child's summer earnings is a powerful way to teach them about saving, investing, and building long-term wealth. It's never too early to start! 🌟 📣 Oh, and don't forget, they may need help filling out their Form W-4 If your child earns less than $14,600 in 2024, they may want to claim an exemption from withholding on their Form W-4 by writing \"Exempt\" on line 4(c) of the form. With a Roth IRA, remember that to qualify for the tax-free and penalty-free withdrawal of earnings, Roth IRA distributions must meet a five-year holding requirement and occur after age 59½. Tax-free and penalty-free withdrawals can also be taken under certain other circumstances, such as the examples in the post. The original Roth IRA owner is not required to take minimum annual withdrawals. This post is for informational purposes only and is not a replacement for real-life advice. Consider consulting your tax, legal, and accounting professionals if you have questions about completing the Form W-4. Hope these summer financial tips are helpful!

        "#Altcoins are in a bull cycle, but how to handle flash crashes? Today has shown that altcoins are super volatile. They are able to drop by 10% when $BTC sneezes. They are certain strategies that you can follow through those times. Let's discuss flash crashes on #Altcoins. Altcoins are super illiquid and when the sentiment is positive, people tend to overleverage themselves on illiquid assets to make more money. Simple. This means that, once the markets are rotating, the long positions are getting liquidated/stopped out, however, the liquidity that comes back into the order books through those forced sells is way larger than what the markets can absorb. Especially in an event where Bitcoin makes it standard 5-10% correction on a day to take the liquidity on the long side. This is likely going to cause a chainreaction across markets with deep wicks of corrections of 20-40% on the markets for altcoins. That's where they come from and that's what I mean by 'flash crashes'. What are strategies for those periods? 1 - The best thing is to be patient and to accumulate your altcoin positions NOW. In this accumulation period is the easiest period to be building those positions as the markets haven't gone vertical, yet. If that happens, then you don't need to be doing much doring those flash crashes. It's just a reset of the markets. Avoid any emotional behavior and just sit through it. 2 - If you don't have any position or you want to add to your position, those flash crashes are the most optimal entry points you could wish for. On social media, people are likely going to be stating that markets are going to go way deeper, and that's what you need to avoid. Just step into the markets, buy after those massive corrections that take place and start to hold. Being patient is the best thing to maximize your returns. The past cycle I've had a few 100x+ runs on coins. How? By sitting on my hands. It's difficult, but you can do it.",

        "This means that, once the markets are rotating, the long positions are getting liquidated/stopped out, however, the liquidity that comes back into the order books through those forced sells is way larger than what the markets can absorb.",
        "Especially in an event where Bitcoin makes it standard 5-10% correction on a day to take the liquidity on the long side.",
        "This is likely going to cause a chainreaction across markets with deep wicks of corrections of 20-40% on the markets for altcoins.",
        "That's where they come from and that's what I mean by 'flash crashes'.",
        "What are strategies for those periods?",
        "1 - The best thing is to be patient and to accumulate your altcoin positions NOW. In this accumulation period is the easiest period to be building those positions as the markets haven't gone vertical, yet.",
        "If that happens, then you don't need to be doing much doring those flash crashes. It's just a reset of the markets. Avoid any emotional behavior and just sit through it.",
        "2 - If you don't have any position or you want to add to your position, those flash crashes are the most optimal entry points you could wish for. On social media, people are likely going to be stating that markets are going to go way deeper, and that's what you need to avoid.",
        "Just step into the markets, buy after those massive corrections that take place and start to hold.",
        "Being patient is the best thing to maximize your returns. The past cycle I've had a few 100x+ runs on coins. How? By sitting on my hands.",
        "It's difficult, but you can do it.",

        "Thanks to the Great Dr. René Fischer, Sebastian Maus and Maarten Bakker we had a chance to exchange the views on the FiDA Regulation of the EU Commission. What resonated with me is the scope of product info that is envisioned as “to be opened up” - all across the balance sheet (and non-balance, the collaterals) and with lots of details on conditions and features. Seems like a way for tapping into the data dream of retail banking: finally a possibility to acquire insights in a fully digital fashion, instantly and in a trusted way. Obviously all based on Client consent. But a question arises immediately - is this the 2nd wave of PSD2 open banking where going beyond compliance has not brought around impressive new business models that would turn banks or TPPs into market leaders. We all use it, we make a bit of money here and there, but definitely not on a scale that was once imagined. What are your key thoughts on FiDA? Do we go for it full speed?",

        "Saudi Arabia is in talks to build a $12.8 billion (estimated) data center with 1GW of capacity at the Oxagon, NEOM 🔽 But what’s the magic number? How much capacity do we actually need? I shared insights on the market over the last couple of weeks. Have added a couple of projects to the list with some interesting insights. ✳️ Take a look: → Pure Data Centres Group & Dune Vaults Vaults JV targeting 1GW of capacity at an estimated $11 billion → DataVolt’s $5 Billion as the sole investor, has a strategic collaboration with center3 → Zoho Corp investing $133 million to establish two data centers in Riyadh and Jeddah → ServiceNow investing $500 Million for a regional HQ in Riyadh and two data centers → Oracle expanding cloud regions in Riyadh with $1.5 Billion → Amazon Web Services (AWS) $5.3 Billion Investment → MIS - Al Moammar Information Systems Co. has a $2.6B initiative underway to develop 6 centers across the Kingdom → IBM establishing a $250 million software lab in Riyadh. Not a data center but significant consequence to data economy --- The truth is, no one can really predict how much capacity the world will need 5 years from now. For context the current capacity is around 250MW. In Germany it’s around 1GW. At the moment: → 5G coverage is now available across half the Kingdom and growing rapidly. → Data traffic per smartphone is estimated to jump from 5GB in 2023 to 18.7GB in 2029. → Gaming and Esports is segment is growing exponentially. → $500M Eports city is currently under planning in addition to the nation-wide growth. → Every infrastructure project has comprehensive IoT/Edge-enabled systems. → Players like iot squared are accelerating this with a proactive and strategic approach The list goes on ✳️ Demand for data infrastructure capacity and the related solutions will grow exponentially there is no doubt ‣ And this region is going to particularly interesting for this sector with such a broad base of 'blank slate' project and transformations underway",

        "– A New Mindset for Valuing Tech (P3) – GPT SUMMARY In Digital Feudalism - Part 3: From Christopher Columbus to Sam Altman, the concept of digital empires and their valuation is reimagined. Just as Queen Isabella’s investment in Columbus led to the discovery of vast new territories, today’s digital giants—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, and others—are pioneering new “digital continents.” Traditional metrics, designed for industrial-age companies, fail to capture the true value of these entities, which don’t merely sell products or services but create digital spaces they control and monetize like sovereign states. These companies wield power not unlike the colonial empires, extending influence beyond conventional corporate boundaries and reshaping economies, societies, and even governance. The Digital Feudalism Valuation Framework™ is introduced as an alternative, emphasizing control, influence, and territory over revenue or usage—concepts aligned with historical empire valuation rather than modern business models. This framework repositions traditional valuation, urging investors and analysts to think as historians of empire, seeing tech giants not only as corporations but as quasi-sovereign entities with the potential to redefine economic and social orders. The article acknowledges the risks and societal consequences of unchecked corporate power, comparing digital serfs to historical subjects. Regulatory and social pressures, much like historical resistance to empires, are emerging to counterbalance this influence. As these digital titans navigate geopolitical pressures, the article suggests that understanding digital feudalism is essential for grasping the future of global power and economic transformation. Art by GPT – \"The Digital Age,\" merging the style of a Historical Epic with modern digital elements. PREAMBLE: The inspiration behind this series on digital feudalism emerged from an unexpected fusion of experiences. Traversing the Camino de Santiago—an ancient path threaded with history—I reflected on the rise and fall of medieval feudal lords, an era when power was concentrated in the hands of a privileged few. Simultaneously, in internal strategy sessions, my team and I grappled with a modern conundrum: the seemingly boundless ascent of the “Magnificent Seven”—America’s tech giants. Conventional valuation metrics, rooted in traditional industries, appeared woefully insufficient to capture the influence and economic gravity these corporations exert. Over weeks, these distinct threads began to converge, forming the foundation for this series. What started as a modest attempt to reconceptualize these vast digital territories—where data is farmed as if it were the crops of yore, and influence wielded with near-sovereign authority—soon grew into a more ambitious project. Initially, I sought to offer a “new mindset” rather than a “new framework.” Yet as the series evolved, the analysis deepened, and by the third article, these ideas crystallized into what could become a formalized framework for understanding the intricacies of “Digital Land” as a true economic force. The Digital Feudalism Valuation Framework™ sheds light on hidden dimensions of digital value beyond traditional metrics. Early findings resonate with established models, yet they also reveal a distinctive growth potential inherent to digital empires. As we refine this framework across industries and timelines in the coming months, we’ll continue sharing insights from this evolving journey. To those who’ve accompanied me thus far, I extend heartfelt thanks—your engagement has been invaluable. I invite you now to explore this article, share your reflections, and join us as we map the contours of the digital feudalism age. Image: The Castillo de Peñaflor, near Sahagún on the Camino Francés, was a medieval fortress crucial in the Christian reconquest against the Moors. Though now largely in ruins, it held strategic importance in regional defense. Pilgrims on the Camino can view its remnants, offering a glimpse into Spain’s medieval past. Digital Feudalism - Part 3: From Columbus to Sam Altman – A New Mindset for Valuing Tech (P3) – In 1492, Queen Isabella of Castile confronted what might be considered history's most consequential investment decision. Christopher Columbus stood before her, pitching not merely a voyage but a vision that would reshape the world. Had her financial advisors applied the medieval equivalent of modern valuation metrics—perhaps calculating the expected return on the three ships' cost against projected spice trade revenues—they would have deemed the venture ludicrously risky, if not outright foolhardy. Yet the ultimate return on Isabella's investment proved astronomical, though not in the way anyone imagined. Instead of finding a new route to the Indies, Columbus stumbled upon vast continents unknown to Europeans, unleashing an era of unprecedented wealth creation that would transform Spain from a modest European kingdom into the world's most powerful empire. The magnitude of this discovery—millions of square miles of arable land, mountains of silver and gold, and resources beyond imagination—exceeded any conceivable pre-voyage valuation model. Today, we find ourselves at a similar inflection point. In our previous explorations of digital feudalism, in Part 1 we traced how the traditional factors of production—land, labor, and capital—have evolved from physical to digital domains. In Part 2, we examined how new \"digital lords\" have emerged, establishing vast virtual feudal estates that generate wealth through data harvesting rather than crop cultivation. In Part 3, we will confront a crucial question: How do we value these digital domains when traditional metrics prove as inadequate as medieval accounting would have been for measuring the worth of the Americas, a land extension about 84 times larger than Spain and 4 times larger than Europe? In tracing the contours of Digital Feudalism, we now turn in this article to the grander notion of empires. Today’s digital titans stand as the empires of our age—vast, centralized forces of control across both physical and digital geographies. However, there is a fascinating paradox: these digital feudal lords, despite their near-imperial reach, may still act as subjects to the “kings” of their countries of operation, navigating a delicate balance between global power and national allegiance. Art by GPT - \"The Queen's Decision,\" combining the grandeur of Renaissance painting with subtle, futuristic elements. A word of proportion, while the parallels between Columbus’s voyages and today’s digital empires illuminate the transformative scale of both, we must recall the tragic human toll of the Americas’ conquest—displacement, suffering, and cultural upheaval. Acknowledging this nuance sharpens our understanding: past and present explorations share scale but diverge sharply in their human impact. The Folly of Traditional Metrics Consider for a moment how a 15th-century Spanish accountant might have attempted to value Columbus's venture. They would have focused on known variables: ship costs, crew wages, provisions, and potential spice trade revenues. Such calculations would have completely missed the transformative potential of discovering entirely new continents. Similarly, today's conventional valuation methods—P/E ratios, discounted cash flows, and other traditional metrics—systematically undervalue companies that are essentially discovering and claiming new \"digital continents.\" The \"Magnificent Seven\" (MAG 7)—Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet, Meta, Amazon, Nvidia, and Tesla—along with enterprises like OpenAI, are not merely large corporations; they are the equivalent of colonial powers establishing claims over vast digital territories. Their value lies not in traditional profit metrics but in their ability to control and exploit these new domains. Just as the Spanish Empire's worth couldn't be measured merely by its annual gold shipments, the true value of these digital empires extends far beyond quarterly earnings reports. Art by GPT – \"The Folly of Traditional Metrics,\" illustrating the blend of historical and futuristic elements to convey the limitations of conventional valuation methods. The New Territories When Columbus returned with news of his discovery, he didn't just report on the gold he'd found; he opened European minds to the existence of entire continents ripe for exploitation. Similarly, companies like OpenAI aren't merely developing products—they're revealing entirely new territories of possibility. The advent of Large Language Models isn't comparable to a new product launch; it's akin to discovering a new continent of human-machine interaction, with implications as profound as the discovery of the Americas. Tesla isn't merely an automaker; it's claiming territory in autonomous systems, energy infrastructure and humanoid robotics. Nvidia isn't simply producing chips; it's establishing dominion over the fundamental infrastructure of AI computation and virtual production ecosystems. These companies are creating, claiming and controlling new digital lands that simply didn't exist before, making traditional valuation metrics as irrelevant as applying medieval agricultural productivity measures to the vast expanses of the Americas. The Inadequacy of Traditional Frameworks The S&P 500's traditional valuation metrics rest upon assumptions forged in the industrial age: predictable cash flows, tangible assets, and measurable market sizes. Yet how does one measure the market size for something that doesn't yet exist? In 1492, no European could have accurately valued the economic potential of the Americas—the very concept of these continents lay beyond their imagination. Similarly, when OpenAI released ChatGPT, how could any traditional valuation model have captured the worth of a technology that fundamentally alters human-machine interaction? The market's puzzlement over the MAG 7's seemingly gravity-defying valuations reflects this cognitive limitation. Critics who claim these companies are overvalued are committing the same error as those 16th-century scholars who insisted Columbus's calculations about reaching Asia were wrong. They were right about the calculations but missed the larger truth—that something far more valuable lay over the horizon. Art by GPT – \"Power Networks\" modernist-style painting inspired by the concept of digital feudalism, reflecting the transition from traditional feudal structures to modern digital power dynamics. The inclusion of the MAG 7 in the S&P 500 increasingly appears anachronistic. These companies operate under fundamentally different rules than traditional corporations. They are more akin to the chartered trading companies of the colonial era—the British East India Company or the Dutch East India Company—which were hybrid entities combining commercial and sovereign powers. Just as the Dutch East India Company possessed powers to wage war, negotiate treaties, and establish colonies, today's tech giants wield quasi-sovereign powers: they create their own digital currencies, establish and enforce rules within their digital territories, and negotiate directly with national governments. Traditional corporate valuation metrics simply cannot capture this level of influence and control, just as medieval accounting methods would have failed to measure the true value of colonial trading companies. Modern tech giants may not command armies or govern physical lands, yet their power in shaping global standards, steering regulations, and swaying economies is profound. Their vast lobbying and dominance in policy dialogues blur the line between corporate might and quasi-sovereign authority, redefining influence in the digital age. The Coming Transformation The wealth generated by Spain's American territories transformed not just Spain but the entire global economy. Silver from Potosí reshaped global trade, eventually reaching as far as Ming China. Today's digital empires are driving a similarly profound transformation. The question isn't whether the MAG 7 and their ilk are overvalued—it's whether we fully grasp the magnitude of the change they represent. Just as the Spanish conquest displaced the existing powers of its day—particularly the Ottoman Empire and the Italian city-states that had grown rich controlling Mediterranean trade—today's digital empires are displacing industrial-age incumbents. The velocity of this displacement, however, far exceeds anything witnessed in the colonial era. What took centuries then occurs in decades or even years now. Yet, as history teaches us, great expansions often come with unseen consequences. Art by GPT - \"The Digital Serfs\". Mural-style painting of modern users interacting with digital elements, inspired by Mexican Muralism. Warnings from the Age of Empires As we look closer at these digital empires, we must remember that power without oversight brings significant risks. Just as the conquest of the Americas brought unprecedented prosperity to European empires while unleashing devastating consequences for indigenous populations, today's digital feudalism carries its own societal perils. The exploitation of digital serfs—billions of users whose data, attention, and digital labor are harvested relentlessly— within an ESG framework raises fundamental concerns, particularly regarding social responsibility and justice, and corporate governance in our emerging digital age, as we explored extensively in Article 2. The rise of digital empires transcends mere economics, presenting urgent challenges to national sovereignty, corporate governance and social responsibility. Monopolistic practices and unbridled data harvesting not only threaten user autonomy but raise serious questions particularly about the 'S' and 'G' in ESG frameworks. The widening digital divide amplifies societal disparities, creating a new class system that mirrors colonial-era inequalities. The digital lords' vast data collection efforts often transgress traditional boundaries of privacy, while their algorithmic systems shape behavior and influence thought patterns with unprecedented precision. This concentration of power in the hands of a few private entities poses governance challenges that would have given pause even to the most ambitious colonial administrators. The lack of democratic oversight and accountability mechanisms eerily echoes the unchecked power of medieval feudal landlords. Art by GPT – 'Resistance and Paradox in Digital Feudalism', illustrating the intricate power dynamics between digital empires and modern governance. Predictably, this has sparked political, institutional and social resistance. Just as colonial exploitation faced indigenous resistance and later, independence movements, we're witnessing growing pushback against digital feudalism. Privacy regulations like Europe's GDPR, antitrust investigations, and calls for digital sovereignty represent modern governance frameworks attempting to address these power imbalances. Meanwhile, movements promoting data privacy and decentralized technologies mirror historical struggles for social justice and self-determination. This points to the fact that despite their near-imperial reach, tech giants like Amazon and Alphabet remain anchored to their geopolitical roots, bound to the constraints and demands of their home nations. The notion of digital lords as subjects to the “kings” of their base countries introduces a fascinating paradox in Digital Feudalism. Modern governments—these sovereign “kings”—can demand compliance, wield regulation, or assert control over data and influence. It’s a delicate power dance, where digital titans flex global might yet remain vassals within their own kingdoms, navigating a balance reminiscent of feudal lords serving their medieval sovereigns, caught between independence and allegiance to the state's enduring power. Art by GPT – \"Resistance and Regulation,\" blending Revolutionary Art with Cyber-aesthetic to depict a modern digital protest scene. Smart investors must factor these dynamics into their calculations. The backlash against digital feudalism—whether through regulation, social movements, or technological disruption—could significantly impact the long-term sustainability and viability of digital empires. History suggests that unchecked corporate power inevitably faces social and governance corrections. The New Metrics of Digital Empire These cautionary tales serve as stark reminders that unchecked power, whether wielded by colonial empires or today’s digital lords, brings profound risks. To navigate the opportunities and complexities of this new era, we require valuation perspectives that reach beyond conventional methods and truly reflect the dominion of these vast digital lands. Just as the Spanish Empire required new frameworks to measure and manage its unprecedented territorial gains, we need new metrics to value digital empires. The traditional corporate valuation methods are as inadequate for this task as medieval accounting would have been for measuring the wealth of the Americas. Instead, we must develop tools that capture both the current dominion and future potential of these digital territories. Here, we outline the foundational pillars of the Digital Feudalism Valuation Framework™. From the outset of this series, the goal has been to offer a perspective that frames this new digital landscape. The following are the key elements that shape this mindset, providing a comprehensive lens through which to understand Digital Feudalism (DF) in a financial valuation context. Art by GPT – \"The New Metrics of Digital Empire,\" portraying the intersection of historical and futuristic valuation methods through abstract geometric forms. Conventional investment analysis has long relied on a set of established metrics to evaluate technology companies. These include fundamental financial measures like DCF valuations and ROIC, alongside more sophisticated tools such as network effects, real options, value at risk, and scenario analysis. While effective for more conventional and incremental business models, these metrics and tools were developed and implemented with a mindset where digital companies primarily provide services rather than command territories. The DF Valuation Framework™ introduces new dimensions that better capture the feudal-like power dynamics of modern tech giants. By conceptualizing digital space as territory to be controlled rather than merely services to be provided, it measures digital territorial holdings, algorithmic control, and technical sovereignty. Most critically, it evaluates companies as digital lords, assessing their ability to maintain vassals or dependents, defend territories, and extract value through feudal-like control structures. This paradigm shift transforms how we understand and value digital power in the modern economy. The DF Framework synthesizes all valuation components into a comprehensive digital feudal value assessment. It first combines traditional valuation metrics, with digital territory worth, power premiums, network effects, feudal control advantages, and innovation potential, while adjusting for risks. This creates an integrated framework for understanding total value in a digital feudal context. Then, it explores multiple potential futures for the organization's digital feudal position through different scenarios. It examines conservative, base, optimistic, and transformative cases to understand value ranges and strategic implications. This component provides a spectrum of possible outcomes based on varying degrees of digital feudal power achievement. This mindset acknowledges that we're not merely valuing companies but appraising digital empires whose influence extends far beyond traditional corporate boundaries. Like the dominant trading companies of the colonial era, these entities combine commercial power with quasi-sovereign authority, requiring us to think in terms of empires rather than mere corporations. Art by GPT – “Empires of the Digital Realm”. Surreal depiction of digital territories as towering strongholds, connected by ethereal pathways, symbolizing control, dominance, and the new power dynamics within the digital landscape. Beyond the Surface - The Anatomy of Digital Territory Control Here are some of the most novel/differentiating elements of the DF Valuation Framework™. 1. Digital Territory Value Conceptualization Current Practice: Focuses on user base size and engagement, DF Innovation: Views digital space as \"territory\" that can be controlled and monetized, similar to physical land. 2. Platform Lock-in Quantification Current Practice: Measures switching costs qualitatively, DF Innovation: Creates specific metrics for quantifying platform dependency and ecosystem control. 3. Cross-platform Synergies Current Practice: Evaluates each platform separately, DF Innovation: Measures value creation across platforms, dependents and ecosystems. 4. Digital Power Assessment Current Practice: Limited focus on market share and competition, DF Innovation: Explicitly measures control over digital infrastructure, algorithms, and data. The Real Innovation of the DF Valuation Framework™: The key innovation is not in individual metrics but in, The feudal power framework for understanding digital companies, Systematic quantification of digital control and influence, Integration of power metrics with traditional valuation, Treatment of digital territory as analogous to physical land, Focus on measuring control rather than just usage or revenue. The critical insight of the framework is that it shifts valuation focus from: Usage → Control Revenue → Power Growth → Territory Competition → Dominance. Art by GPT - \" The Digital Graffiti Empire”. Vibrant street-art depiction of digital territories and power, blending bold colors, abstract shapes, and symbols of control in a rebellious urban style, embodying the raw energy of digital dominance. The Digital Feudalism Valuation Framework™ offers a lens for understanding the mechanisms of digital value creation—capturing nuances that conventional metrics may not capture. While some components might align with established valuation models, this framework delves into new dimensions uniquely suited to digital empires. The preliminary results that we have obtained are promising. When measured against leading-edge valuation approaches, our framework not only aligns in its foundational findings but also reveals untapped layers of value that reflect the actual growth experienced in the market valuations of these companies over the past several years, dynamics unaccounted and unexplainable by conventional metrics. These early insights are but the first chapter in a broader exploration. Over the coming months, we plan to conduct extensive validations across different companies, industries and time horizons, refining the framework’s rigor. Along the way, we may share further articles to chronicle our progress and discoveries. The Future of Digital Feudalism Yet as we delve deeper into this framework, a more profound question arises: just how expansive can these digital empires become? Much like the monarchs who funded voyages into unknown realms, traditional valuation methods can only hint at the transformative potential of these digital domains. The true scope of digital feudalism lies not in incremental growth but in the unprecedented creation of new markets and territories. Thus, we turn to the future of digital feudalism. The question of whether there's a ceiling to the value of these digital empires misses the point entirely. When Queen Isabella backed Columbus's venture, asking about the maximum potential return would have been meaningless—the very concept of the Americas lay beyond European imagination. Similarly, today's digital empires are not merely growing within existing markets; they're creating entirely new ones. Art by GPT - \"The Digital Age,\" blending the grandeur of historical epic art with futuristic digital elements. Amid the ascendancy of tech giants, the future brims with uncertainties. Disruptive innovations, consumer shifts, regulatory pushes, and geopolitical upheavals could alter their course. History is clear: no empire is invincible. Today's digital titans may soon confront unexpected trials that test the resilience of their perceived dominance. As traditional political systems find themselves in a state of flux, struggling to remain relevant and in control amidst extreme polarization, eroding democracies, and citizens losing confidence in governance, we are witnessing the emergence of a new form of sovereignty. Autocracies, emboldened by technological advances, are increasing surveillance and persecution, while democracies waver under the strain of division and dysfunction. In this climate of societal and political turmoil, the digital lords of our age thrive, expanding their influence within their digital feudal territories. Within their domains and beyond, their collective impact reveals them as de facto governments—setting rules, enforcing behavior, extracting value, and manipulating users through platform algorithms. These actions blur the line between corporate might and state authority, redefining where corporate influence ends and sovereign power begins. Art by GPT – \"Algorithmic Control,\" created in the style of Technical Baroque, depicting complex systems of digital control with classical drama and mechanical precision. Conclusion We stand at a moment analogous to the years immediately following Columbus's first voyage. Just as European powers struggled to comprehend and value the newfound territories that would reshape their world, today's investors and analysts grapple with understanding the true worth of digital empires that are transforming ours. The mistake is not in overvaluing these digital territories but in trying to measure them with metrics designed for a different age. Just as Spain's American empire generated wealth that would have been incalculable by 15th-century standards, today's digital empires are creating value that defies industrial-age metrics. The real question for investors is not whether to apply traditional valuation metrics to these companies, but how to participate in what may be the greatest creation and transfer of power and wealth since the Age of Discovery. Those who cling to conventional governance and valuation mindsets risk missing what future historians may view as the defining economic transformation of our era. As we conclude this series on digital feudalism, one thing becomes evident: we are observing not only the rise of powerful companies but also the potential emergence of a new economic order. Understanding this transformation requires us to think less like corporate analysts and more like historians of empires and feudal dynamics. For in the end, what we are witnessing is not merely the success of a few tech companies, but the reorganization of global power and wealth into digital empires that may prove as transformative as the discovery of the New World.

        "Digital Feudalism - Part 2: Lords of the Cloud",
        "– A New Mindset for Valuing Tech (Cont.) – GPT Summary: The essay, \"Digital Feudalism: Lords of the Cloud – A New Mindset for Valuing Tech – Part 2,\" is the second installment in a three-part series exploring the parallels between historical feudalism and the modern digital economy. This essay focuses on the resurgence of rent as the dominant economic force, where the new digital feudal lords harvest value from user data and digital interactions. Unlike traditional capitalism, which relied on profit from goods and services, today's tech \"lords\" like Microsoft, Google, and Amazon extract rent from their control over digital platforms. Smaller companies act as vassals, dependent on these platforms, while users serve as digital serfs, providing data in exchange for \"free\" services. Key Elements: The Return of Rent: Digital feudal lords now derive wealth through rent extracted from user data and digital activity, challenging profit as the primary driver. Digital Hierarchy: A new pyramid structure has emerged, with tech companies as feudal lords, smaller businesses as vassals, and users as serfs tied to platform ecosystems. Geopolitical and Economic Implications: These global digital empires challenge national sovereignty, as their control over data and infrastructure generates regulatory tensions. The final essay will examine new mindsets for valuing these digital empires and their immense, data-driven power. (Related article: Reflections from the Camino de Santiago: The Ancient Path to Modern Leadership) Digital Feudalism - Part 2: Lords of the Cloud – A New Mindset for Valuing Tech (Cont.) – I. The Return of Rent: From Profit to Data In our previous exploration (Digital Feudalism - Part 1: From Charlemagne to Marx to Musk), we traced the evolution of economic power from the land-based feudalism of the Middle Ages to the profit-driven capitalism that emerged during the industrial era. Today, we stand on the threshold of a remarkable historical irony: the re-emergence of rent as the primary source of power in the digital age. This shift marks a profound transformation in the global economic landscape, one that echoes the structures of medieval feudalism, but on a scale and with a complexity that would have baffled even the most prescient medieval lord. The increasing emphasis from profit to rent as the central driver of the modern economy is not merely a theoretical distinction; it signals a tectonic shift in how value is created, extracted, and distributed. In the capitalist model, profit emerged from the efficient allocation of capital and labor to produce goods and services. But in today’s digital feudal order, rent is extracted from something far more pervasive—our data, our attention, and every digital interaction we make. The platforms that dominate this new order do not simply profit from productivity; they harvest value from our very presence in the digital ecosystem, reshaping the dynamics of modern economic power. Image: The Castillo de los Duques de Frías is located in Frías, a small medieval town in Burgos, Spain, just north of the Camino Francés. Perched on a rocky outcrop, it dates back to the 10th century and served as a strategic fortress during conflicts between Christian and Moorish kingdoms. II. The New Feudal Order: Lords, Vassals, and Serfs At the apex of this new feudal pyramid sit the digital lords - the tech giants that have come to dominate our online existence. Chief among these are the so-called MAG 7: Microsoft, Apple, Google (Alphabet), Amazon, Meta (Facebook), Nvidia, and Tesla. These entities have carved out vast digital estates, not measured in acres of land, but in petabytes of data and billions of users. What sets these digital lords apart from their capitalist predecessors is their reliance on rent extraction rather than traditional profit. Every click, every search, every purchase on these platforms generates data - the new fertile soil of the digital age. And just as feudal lords extracted rent from those who worked their land, these tech giants extract value from the data generated by their users. Crucially, this rent often takes the form of a percentage of revenue generated on their platforms, mirroring the proportional crop shares demanded by feudal lords. Yet, not to oversimplify, profit remains a key driver for these companies, as they continue to pursue traditional capitalist goals, even while layering rent extraction on top of their economic models. Image by GPT: abstract, conceptual painting inspired by the economic and social ramifications of digital feudalism. Below the lords in this digital hierarchy are the vassals - smaller tech companies, content creators, and businesses that rely on the major platforms to reach their audience or customers. Consider the app developers who must conform to Apple's App Store policies, surrendering 30% of their revenue as 'rent' for access to the platform. Or the YouTube content creators whose livelihood depends on the platform's algorithms and monetization policies. These digital vassals pay their 'rent' not just through revenue shares, but also through data sharing and adherence to platform rules. At the base of this pyramid are the digital serfs - the billions of users who, in exchange for 'free' services, surrender their data and attention. Unlike their medieval counterparts, these serfs can move between digital fiefs, but the oligopolistic nature of the tech industry means that true escape is nearly impossible. It is important to acknowledge that modern users do exercise more agency than their medieval counterparts, and alternatives like decentralized platforms or movements for data privacy are growing, though still facing significant barriers. However, try living in the modern world without using services from Google, Apple, or Amazon. This is the illusion of choice in the age of digital feudalism. Image by GPT: pop art-style painting capturing the essence of Digital Feudalism: Lords of the Cloud. III. The Nature of Digital Fiefs The digital estates of our new feudal lords are complex and multifaceted. They encompass social media platforms, e-commerce marketplaces, cloud computing services, and increasingly, the realm of artificial intelligence. The recent rise of OpenAI and other Large Language Model (LLM) companies represents a new frontier in this digital land grab, with these entities staking claims on vast territories of language and knowledge. What makes these digital fiefs so valuable is not just their size, but their ability to generate and process data. In this new economy, data is the ultimate resource - more valuable than oil, more precious than gold. It's a resource that, contrary to physical commodities, grows more valuable the more it is used and combined with other data. The lords of these digital fiefs have developed sophisticated methods to maximize the 'yield' of their estates. Gamification techniques and the cultivation of FOMO (Fear of Missing Out) are employed to induce addictive behaviors in users, encouraging them to spend more time on platforms and generate more data. Each like, share, and comment is a tiny piece of rent paid to the digital lord. Image by GPT: impressionist-style painting capturing the transition from medieval feudalism to modern digital feudalism IV. The Question of Ownership In this new feudal order, the question of ownership - particularly of data and content - becomes increasingly murky. In theory, users own the content they create. In practice, the terms of service of most platforms grant the digital lords broad rights to use, analyze, and profit from user-generated content and data. This ambiguity of ownership is reminiscent of the complex land rights in feudal systems, where peasants might have certain rights to work the land, but ultimate ownership and control rested with the lord. In our digital age, we are all peasants tilling fields we do not truly own. Image by GPT: surrealist-style painting capturing the theme of ambiguous ownership in the digital feudal order. V. Geopolitical Implications The rise of digital feudalism has reshaped geopolitical power, as tech giants now rival national governments. During the Arab Spring, platforms like Facebook and Twitter acted as digital lords, bypassing state control and enabling political movements. Similarly, the recent clash between Elon Musk's X and the Brazilian government shows the tension between states and tech platforms, which, unlike traditional multinational corporations, don't require a physical presence or registration in each country, allowing them to bypass local regulations, taxation, and licensing. Yet, it's worth noting that countries like the European Union and the U.S. have initiated significant regulatory efforts to rein in the power of these platforms, which are facing challenges to their digital sovereignty. These digital feuds are not bound by borders, operating globally with minimal direct accountability to national laws in most places. Countries like the United States, base to the MAG 7, hold disproportionate influence over global data flows and content moderation. Meanwhile, nations without their own platforms are relegated to a form of digital serfdom, dependent on foreign tech lords for access to the digital economy. China’s increasing dominance in its own tech sector, through companies like Tencent and Alibaba, shows that some countries are capable of asserting their digital sovereignty, complicating the notion of a single global digital order. The ability to control information and data extraction has become a powerful geopolitical tool, and in this new digital feudal order, tech giants are the new lords. They challenge traditional sovereignty by shaping economies and influencing societies without the constraints faced by traditional corporations or nations. Nevertheless, as more governments recognize the importance of digital sovereignty, regulatory responses could gradually transform these dynamics. Image by GPT: street art and graffiti-style depiction of the geopolitical implications of digital feudalism. VI. Economic and Social Ramifications The concentration of power and wealth in the hands of a few digital lords has far-reaching economic and social consequences. As Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee argue in \"The Second Machine Age,\" this new economic model is reshaping labor markets, concentrating wealth, and redefining productivity. However, it is important to remember that users derive significant value from these platforms—from the flexibility of the gig economy to the global reach of digital marketplaces. These benefits, while real, come with trade-offs in terms of data privacy, income inequality, and labor security. The gig economy, facilitated by digital platforms, offers flexibility but often at the cost of security and benefits - a modern parallel to the freeman farmers of feudal times who traded the harsh certainty of serfdom for precarious independence. Meanwhile, the digital lords amass wealth at an unprecedented rate, exacerbating already stark economic inequalities. Regulators and activists are increasingly raising awareness about these issues, but finding a balance between user empowerment and corporate profit remains elusive. Image by GPT: modernist-style painting inspired by the concept of digital feudalism, reflecting the transition from traditional feudal structures to modern digital power dynamics. VII. The Future of Digital Power Structures As we look to the future, emerging technologies promise to further entrench this new digital feudal order. Artificial Intelligence, in particular, has the potential to widen the gap between the digital lords and their vassals and serfs. Those who control the most advanced AI systems will have unprecedented power to extract value from data, predict trends, and shape outcomes. Yet, history teaches us that no system of power is immutable. Technologies like blockchain and decentralized networks hold the potential to challenge the hegemony of today's digital lords. The rise of blockchain, Web3 and decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) might herald a new era of digital democracy - or they might simply rearrange the feudal order without fundamentally altering its structure. The outcomes are uncertain, but users are increasingly aware of their own power and potential to push for a more decentralized, democratic digital future. Image by GPT: photorealistic image depicting a futuristic digital landscape with towering AI systems and decentralized technologies. As we look ahead to what will be our upcoming third and final piece in this series, we must grapple with a crucial question: How do we value these new digital empires? Traditional metrics of profit and loss seem woefully inadequate when dealing with entities whose true worth lies in their ability to extract rent from vast data realms. Through this thought experiment we have been developing a new mindset that accounts for the unique nature of digital power and its capacity for rent extraction. As we approach the conclusion of this second chapter, the landscape of digital feudalism represents a paradigm shift in how economic power is structured and exercised. As we navigate this new terrain, we would do well to heed the lessons of history while remaining alert to the unique challenges and opportunities of our digital age. The lords, vassals, and serfs of this new order may be digital, but the fundamental dynamics of power and rent extraction would be all too familiar to our feudal ancestors.

        "Digital Feudalism - Part 1: From Charlemagne to Marx to Musk",
        "– A New Mindset for Valuing Tech – GPT Summary: The essay, \"Digital Feudalism: From Charlemagne to Marx to Musk,\" is the first of a three-part series exploring the evolution of economic power from traditional feudalism to today’s digital economy. It examines how control over land in feudal times has transitioned to control “digital land” — platforms and data in the modern era, creating a new class of \"digital feudal lords.\" These tech giants dominate virtual spaces, leveraging user data, platforms, and AI systems to harvest value, much like feudal lords of the past. This shift reflects a return to a rent-based model within the digital economy, where wealth is derived from control over data and attention. The essay also explores how capitalism replaced land with capital as the dominant economic force, yet today’s digital economy introduces “digital land” as a new form of power. Key Elements: Digital Feudalism: Tech giants as the new \"lords\" controlling “digital land”— infrastructure, platforms, and data. Historical Evolution: From feudal land ownership to capitalist profit, and now “digital land” control. From Rent to Profit Back to Rent: The shift from feudal rent-based economies, to profit-driven capitalism, and back to a rent-extracting model in the digital economy. Series Focus: The essay is part of a series, with future articles exploring the landscape of digital feudalism and frameworks for valuing digital empires. (Related article: Reflections from the Camino de Santiago: The Ancient Path to Modern Leadership) Digital Feudalism-Part 1: From Charlemagne to Marx to Musk – A New Mindset for Valuing Tech – As I traversed the ancient paths of the Camino de Santiago (See— Reflections from the Camino de Santiago: The Ancient Path to Modern Leadership), my gaze was continually drawn to the crumbling castles dotting the landscape. These silent sentinels, for centuries the seats of powerful feudal lords, now stand as stark reminders of a bygone era. Their abandoned turrets and overgrown courtyards, once symbols of unassailable power, planted in me the seeds of a profound reflection: how did these centuries old bastions of political and economic might fall into such oblivion, their relevance crumbling like the very stones that formed their walls? What forces could render such imposing structures obsolete, and what lessons might they hold for the power structures of our own time? This question lingered in my mind long after my pilgrimage. Image: The Castle of Castrojeriz is a medieval castle built in the municipality of Castrojeriz, in Burgos. The exact date of the castle’s construction is uncertain, but it is estimated to date back to the late 8th century. It is located in one of the most important Jacobean towns along the Camino de Santiago, as it is said that Castrum Sigerice was founded by Julius Caesar. The castle withstood numerous attacks from troops from northern Europe and Africa. To understand this evolution, we must look back to when land-based hierarchical systems dominated social and economic life. From roughly the 9th to the 16th century in Europe, this took the form of the manorial system, where feudal lords controlled vast estates. Similar systems also existed in other parts of the world, but European feudalism was unique in its structure of reciprocal obligations between lords, vassals, and serfs. Somehow comparable structures existed elsewhere: China's imperial land-grant system during the Tang and Song dynasties, Japan's ritsuryō system followed by the rise of the samurai class, and India's land-based hierarchies under various empires. These systems were not monolithic and varied significantly across regions and over time, but they shared a common thread: the concentration of power in the hands of a land-controlling elite, with the majority of the population tied to the land they worked. The Carolingian system, evolving from the time of Charles Martel through Charlemagne's reign (768-814 AD), was crucial in laying the foundations of European feudalism. Charlemagne expanded this system, formalizing lord-vassal relationships and granting land (fiefs) for military service and loyalty. This approach addressed challenges of managing a vast empire with limited infrastructure. By delegating authority to local lords, the Carolingians created a decentralized yet hierarchical power structure. Charlemagne's innovations, including royal inspectors and standardized currency, strengthened this framework. The system spread throughout Europe, adapting locally but maintaining its core of land-based power and reciprocal obligations, becoming the template for classic European feudalism in the High Middle Ages. Image by GPT: Carolingian system under Charlemagne's reign, with a grand ceremony of land grants and knights in feudal service. Throughout history, the factors of production—land, labor, and capital—have evolved with the shifting dynamics of power and wealth. In feudalism, the primary source of power was land, which was controlled by a class of lords who extracted value through the labor of serfs tied to the land. While there were variations and exceptions, with some individuals finding ways to improve their social standing, broadly speaking, this static, hierarchical system was characterized by limited social mobility and rigid class structures. The transition to mercantilism (16th to 18th century). While it existed alongside feudal structures in many parts of Europe and the world well before the 16th century, Mercantilism represented a shift where trade began to complement land as a major source of wealth, though land remained central in many agrarian societies, as trade and emergent nation-states began to wield power. Proto-corporations like the East India Company controlled vast global trade networks, utilizing armies and state-like authority to extract wealth, much like today's tech giants. This period saw a gradual shift in economic power structures, though the process was neither uniform nor without resistance. Image by GPT: Adam Smith in a study, with the transition from agricultural fields to industrial factories in the background, symbolizing the shift from land to capital. Karl Marx is also depicted contemplating the rise of industrial capitalism, while subtle futuristic elements hint at the modern shift to digital land. Adam Smith, whose ideas emerged before the industrial era, championed the shift towards capitalism, where capital gained importance over land, though he critiqued mercantilism rather than industrial capitalism directly: capital—factories, machinery, and financial assets—became the dominant force, followed by labor, with land now in third place. This new hierarchy drove wealth creation, fostering the free market and greater economic mobility. While Smith identified profit as the primary driver of capitalism, in contrast to the rent-driven model of feudalism, he also acknowledged the ongoing significance of rent, particularly in relation to land. The shift from rent to profit as the main economic motivator fundamentally altered the dynamics of wealth creation and distribution. Although the transition posed its own set of challenges, capitalism’s pursuit of profit through the efficient allocation of capital and labor became the engine of economic growth. This encouraged innovation and entrepreneurship in ways that the static, rent-seeking feudal system could not, though Smith's recognition of rent as a continuing part of the economy suggests that the transition from feudalism was more nuanced than a simple replacement of rent with profit. Karl Marx, however, critiqued this capitalist restructuring, arguing that it created a system where the bourgeoisie (owners of capital) exploited the proletariat (providers of labor), perpetuating inequality under a new guise. Central to Marx’s analysis was the concept of surplus value, where the bourgeoisie extracted excess value from labor, reinforcing the class struggle that had shifted from landowners and serfs to capitalists and workers. Marx saw the elevation of capital over labor as the root of this conflict, despite land's diminished role compared to feudal times. While Marx’s critique highlights systemic inequality inherent in capitalism, it's important to note that capitalist societies have evolved and adapted over time, often incorporating elements of social welfare, labor rights, and broader safety nets, which have mitigated some of the harshest aspects of exploitation that Marx identified. Nonetheless, his critique remains relevant in analyzing ongoing disparities in wealth and power. Image by GPT: The challenge of valuing new digital empires, showing the contrast between crumbling medieval castles and futuristic digital fortresses, connected by glowing digital pathways. However, just as feudal lords built castles, mills, and infrastructure to control and extract value from their land, today's digital lords invest in data centers, cloud infrastructure, and AI systems, creating a form of “digital land”. These tech giants don’t just possess data; they transform it into value through sophisticated algorithms and vast computational power. Like medieval lords who needed infrastructure to control their domains, modern platforms rely on these digital fortresses to maintain dominance, converting raw data into insights and further entrenching their power over the digital economy and its users. In the digital age, we now see the emergence of \"digital feudalism,\" where control over \"digital land\"—platforms, data, and algorithms—has become a new source of power. Just as in feudal times, a small elite exercises control over vast territories, only now these are virtual spaces, and the wealth harvested is based on the data and digital labor of billions of users, reinforcing dynamics of power and dependence in a modern, high-tech framework. However, it's important to note that unlike historical serfs, digital users often have choices (apparently) and can benefit from the services provided by tech platforms. We will delve deeper into this notion in the next article. This shift marks a return to a rent-based economic model that is already very significant and continues to grow more so by the day, coexisting alongside the profit-driven paradigm of capitalism. In this emerging digital economy, tech giants derive a significant portion of their wealth not just from profit on goods or services sold, but from the rent they extract through control of digital platforms and data. This rent comes in the form of user data, attention, and platform fees, bearing some resemblance to how feudal lords harvested rents from those who lived and worked on their lands. This model concentrates wealth and power in the hands of those who control the digital territories, echoing some aspects of feudal economic structures. Though this system disrupts traditional capitalism, it is expected to coexist with capitalist frameworks across many sectors and industries over the long term. We will explore this concept in greater detail in the third article of this series. Image by GPT: Concept of \"digital feudalism,\" where towering data centers and cloud infrastructures resemble digital fortresses, symbolizing tech giants' control over \"digital land.\" Streams of data and networks flow like rivers, representing the extraction of value from digital labor. The emergence of AI-driven players like OpenAI and the dominance of the MAG 7 (Microsoft, Apple, Alphabet/Google, Amazon, Meta, Nvidia, and Tesla) represent a new chapter in this digital transformation, where control over vast digital territories, from cloud infrastructure to AI models, is concentrated in the hands of a few tech giants. These companies shape the rules of the digital economy by controlling access to essential platforms, data, and AI-driven technologies. Much like medieval lords who wielded power through land ownership, today's tech leaders leverage their dominance over digital infrastructure to harvest value from businesses, users, and developers, fostering a degree of dependency on their ecosystems. On the positive side, it's essential to acknowledge that these companies also foster innovation and offer services that have revolutionized various aspects of modern life. This digital transformation marks a pivotal shift in civilization, potentially rivaling and even surpassing the Agricultural and Industrial Revolutions in its impact on humanity. Silicon Valley's tech titans, in some ways reminiscent of the Medicis of Renaissance Italy, wield data and algorithms as their predecessors wielded gold and patronage. This digital elite isn't merely reshaping our online world; they're influencing the very fabric of society. The nation-state, that stubborn survivor of centuries of upheaval, finds itself challenged by borderless digital empires. We're witnessing the emergence of a new global hierarchy where status is increasingly determined by data control and AI sophistication. This shift echoes historical power transitions like the fall of Rome or the rise of the nation-state. The question remains: will our democratic institutions adapt to this new reality, or struggle to keep pace with rapid technological and economic changes? Image by GPT: Dominance of the MAG 7 in controlling vast digital territories. It blends futuristic digital art with classical elements to highlight the parallels with historical empires, reflecting the impact of this digital transformation. It's intriguing to consider how the great economic thinkers of the past might view this shift. Adam Smith, the champion of free markets and capitalism, might be concerned by the concentration of power in the hands of a few tech giants. He could argue that this new digital landscape, if not properly regulated, risks stifling the very competition and innovation that he saw as crucial for societal progress and wealth creation. As we navigate the still early stages of this new digital age, many questions remain unanswered. How will this landscape evolve? What are the implications for businesses, individuals, and society at large? How do we value these new digital empires that seem to defy traditional economic and financial metrics? Moreover, how do we guarantee that the advantages of the digital revolution are implemented responsibly for the greater good of both the economy and society at large? In the next article of this series, we will delve deeper into \"The Landscape of Digital Feudalism.\" We'll explore the intricate power dynamics between digital platforms, businesses, and users, and examine how these relationships are reshaping our economic, political and social structures. From the multidimensionality of digital ecosystems to the geopolitical implications of digital sovereignty, we'll map out the contours of this new digital order. Image by GPT: Contrast of historical feudalism on the left with modern digital feudalism on the right. The two sides show the transition from land-based power to digital control, with the contrast between medieval realism and digital abstraction Following that, our final piece will tackle the challenging question of \"Valuing the New Digital Empires.\" Traditional valuation mindsets and methods fall short when applied to these data-driven, network-effect-powered entities. We'll explore new frameworks for understanding and quantifying the worth of these digital fiefdoms, drawing parallels with historical attempts to value uncharted territories and potential resources. As we continue this journey through the evolving landscape of economic power, I invite you to stay tuned for these upcoming articles. Together, we'll unravel the complexities of our digital age and strive to understand the profound transformations reshaping our world. We'll also explore potential alternatives and resistances to this model, recognizing that the future is not predetermined and that societal choices will play a crucial role in shaping our digital future. The castles of old may lie in ruins, but the digital fortresses of our time are still being built. Understanding their architecture, their power, and their value will be crucial as we decipher the challenges and opportunities of this new digital era. Image: The Castle of Ponferrada, also known as the Castle of the Templars, is a medieval fortress located in Ponferrada, León. Built in the 12th century by the Order of the Temple, it played a crucial role in the defense of northwestern Spain. Today, the Castle of Ponferrada is a landmark along the Camino de Santiago.

Rewiring Humanity: Harari and Ferguson Debate Technological Disruption – A Fictional Dialogue Niall Ferguson: When we examine technological disruption through a historical lens, we see striking parallels to past revolutions, particularly the Industrial Revolution. Just as steam power and mechanization transformed economies and global power structures in the 19th century, we're now witnessing AI, robotics, and automation reshaping our world. However, I'm deeply concerned about the geopolitical ramifications. The concentration of wealth and power in certain nations and tech companies could lead to a significant realignment of global influence. We might even see tech giants becoming as powerful as nation-states themselves. How do you view these developments, Yuval? Yuval Noah Harari: Your historical comparison is insightful, Niall, but I believe we're witnessing a shift far deeper than anything we've seen before. The Industrial Revolution transformed the way we lived and worked, but the technologies of today—AI, biotechnology—are altering the very fabric of what it means to be human. These aren't just tools for external change; they are tools for internal transformation, potentially creating new life forms and intelligences that challenge our most basic ideas of free will and individuality. The real question we face isn’t just about economies or labor markets—it’s about power. Who will control these new forces of creation? Could we see the emergence of a new 'Homo Deus' class, leaving the rest of humanity behind as an evolutionary footnote? The stakes are not simply economic inequality; they are the potential creation of a biological divide that could shape our species for thousands of years. Title: \"From Steam to Silicon: The Quantum Leap of Progress\". Image created by AI. inspired by the text about technological disruption, comparing it to past revolutions like the Industrial Revolution and highlighting the modern era of AI, robotics, and automation. Ferguson: Well, Yuval, that's a crucial point that you make about control and power. Historically, technological superiority has been a cornerstone of global dominance, as we saw with the British Empire and the United States in the 20th century, and throughout the ages, for that matter. Now, with AI and data becoming the new currency of power, we're seeing a similar dynamic unfold. In that light, I'm particularly worried about the potential shift of power from states to corporations. Companies like Google, Amazon, and Tencent have global reach and influence that rivals that of nation-states. Could we be heading towards a future where these tech corporations become the new superpowers, eclipsing traditional geopolitical entities? Harari: Absolutely, and while fully agreeing with those concerns, I'd argue that it goes beyond just economic or political power. These corporations control the algorithms that increasingly shape our thoughts, desires, and interactions. Imagine a future where AI knows you better than you know yourself, predicting and influencing your decisions, even controlling your access to resources. This unprecedented power to manipulate human behavior on a very large scale raises profound ethical questions. If we fail to implement adequate protective measures, we risk the emergence of what I've called \"digital dictatorships,\" where a few entities control vast populations through data and algorithms. Title: \"The Invisible Chains: Dawn of the Algorithmic Autocracy\". Image created by AI. Here is the image inspired by the concept of digital dictatorships, where powerful entities control algorithms that influence human behavior, thoughts, and access to resources. Ferguson: Well, that is certainly a disturbing thought, which I think brings us to the critical issue of governance. Historically, we've mitigated technological disruptions through political institutions - the welfare state, for instance, emerged partly to cushion the impact of industrialization. But I question whether our current institutions can adapt quickly enough to the pace of technological change. Democracy itself could be at risk if governments fail to keep up. Furthermore, echoing patterns seen throughout millennia of human civilization, we're witnessing a new era of geopolitical rivalry. Nations like China and the United States are now competing to dominate the critical resources of the future—primarily AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology, among others. Should any power gain a decisive edge in these technologies, we could face a scenario more complex and potentially more dangerous than the Cold War. Harari: Niall, while those a truly critical points, in my mind, this AI and biotech race goes beyond military or economic power. We're reshaping humanity itself. For the first time, we can redesign our own minds and bodies. This could lead to unprecedented flourishing or to a dystopian biological caste system. Will AI serve us, or will we create digital dictatorships where algorithms control our lives? We're not just shifting geopolitics; we're determining the next stage of human evolution. The decisions we make now will shape the very essence of future human existence. The decisions made in the coming decades could determine whether we enter an era of unprecedented prosperity and health or one of greater inequality and instability. If we're not careful, we might create a new species of enhanced humans who dominate the rest of us, leading to a biological caste system that could persist for generations. Title: \"Empires of Code: The 21st Century Scramble for Tech Dominance\". Image created by AI. Inspired by the historical struggle of political institutions adapting to rapid technological change and the modern geopolitical race for dominance in AI, quantum computing, and biotechnology. Ferguson: Fair points Yuval, on that line of inequality, your reflections remind me of several historical precedents. Extreme inequality has often led to instability, revolution, and even war. We saw this during the Gilded Age when industrial tycoons amassed vast fortunes while millions lived in poverty. Today's tech oligarchs could create a similar dynamic if the benefits of technology aren't widely shared. But we're also dealing with a new kind of instability born from the sheer speed of change. In the 19th century, societies had decades to adjust to industrial disruptions. Now, change is happening so rapidly that people and institutions are struggling to keep pace. Can our social and political structures evolve quickly enough to manage the fallout? Harari: That's indeed the critical challenge Niall. We need new frameworks for governance, ethics, and economics that can adapt to this rapid pace of change. But again, and please allow me to insist on this, it's not just about governance - there's a deeper philosophical question at stake. As technology begins to reshape human nature itself, we must ask: What kind of future do we want to create? Should we allow AI to make decisions for us? Should we pursue immortality or enhanced cognition through biotechnology? These questions go beyond economics and geopolitics - they touch on the very essence of what it means to be human. Title: \"Blueprints for Humanity 2.0: Rewriting the Code of Civilization\". Image created by AI. inspired by the concept of new frameworks for governance, ethics, and economics adapting to the rapid pace of technological change. It reflects the deep philosophical questions about the future of humanity and technology. Ferguson: Indeed, Yuval. As a historian, I'm acutely aware that each technological revolution throughout history has produced its share of victors and vanquished. However, the stakes in this digital revolution dwarf those of the past. We're not merely reshuffling economic fortunes; we're gambling with the very fabric of human civilization. While history offers crucial lessons, we must acknowledge that we're venturing into truly uncharted waters. The potential for both progress and peril is unprecedented, making our current juncture perhaps the most pivotal in human history. Harari: We are indeed in uncharted waters. But one thing is clear: the decisions we make now will reverberate through the centuries. Whether we create a future of prosperity and harmony or one of division and chaos depends on our ability to balance technological progress with ethical wisdom. The future of humanity may well depend on how we navigate this delicate balance. Ferguson: The stakes are high, Yuval, and the paths we choose now will reverberate for generations. Let’s hope we have the wisdom to steer them in the right direction.\" Harari: Let's hope so, Niall. The future, as always, remains uncertain - but it's in our hands.

        "🟡 #mentalhealth 🟢 #motivational In today’s fast-paced world, it's easy to believe that happiness and success are found elsewhere. However, true satisfaction often comes from nurturing and investing in what you already have. This principle is essential in personal growth, relationships, and professional development. ### The Importance of Nurturing Your Current Circumstances Rather than seeking new opportunities or environments, consider the value of enhancing your current situation. Whether it's a job, a relationship, or a personal goal, investing time and effort can lead to greater fulfillment. This approach emphasizes commitment, patience, and hard work. ### Personal Growth Self-improvement doesn't always require drastic changes. Significant growth can happen when you develop your existing skills and strengths. For example, advancing in your career might be more beneficial through additional training in your current field than switching industries. ### Relationships Building strong, healthy relationships requires continuous effort. Instead of looking elsewhere for happiness, focus on nurturing the relationships you already have. Communication, understanding, and respect can transform an existing relationship into a more fulfilling one. ### Professional Development In your career, growing within your current organization can be highly rewarding. Seek new challenges, take on more responsibilities, and improve your skills. This not only enhances your capabilities but also shows your value and commitment to your employer. ### Example Consider Jane, a marketing manager who felt unfulfilled. Instead of searching for a new job, she decided to grow within her company. Jane led new projects, took advanced courses, and sought mentorship. Her efforts were recognized, leading to a promotion and increased job satisfaction. ### Conclusion The idea that \"the grass is greener where you water it\" reminds us that fulfillment and success are often within reach if we invest effort and time. By focusing on nurturing our current circumstances, we can achieve growth and satisfaction without constantly seeking external changes. This approach leads to a more fulfilling and balanced life.",

        "Creativity is like a magical touch that turns the everyday into something special. Imagine a world where every old thing, every cast-off idea, gets a chance at a new life, becoming extraordinary in the process. It's about seeing beyond the surface, finding hidden gems in the ordinary. Creativity steps in when faced with waste, ready to perform its transformative magic. It's not just about salvaging what's left behind but about seeing the potential for rebirth and reinvention. Think of waste as a canvas waiting for the strokes of creativity. It's not just about making things usable again; it's about making them truly remarkable. Creativity doesn't settle; it pushes boundaries and challenges norms. When it comes to repurposing waste, creativity sees opportunity where others see only trash. It's about turning what's considered useless into something valuable, both in function and beauty. #Creativity, at its core, is a mindset of innovation and resourcefulness. It's about making connections between unrelated things and finding beauty in the unexpected. In a world concerned about waste, creativity becomes a tool for #sustainability, seeing waste not as a problem but as an opportunity. Let's look at the world with fresh eyes, ready to turn the overlooked into the outstanding. Through creative thinking, we not only unlock hidden value but also contribute to a more sustainable and imaginative future. Feel free to #share your thoughts and /or #reshare the post. 😊 Have a beautiful day. 💖♻️ #whatinspiresme #innovation #inspiration #solutions",
