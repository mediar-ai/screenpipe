MCP server for screenpipe - search your screen recordings, audio transcriptions, and control your computer with AI.

## Installation

### Option 1: NPX (Recommended)

The easiest way to use screenpipe-mcp is with npx. Edit your Claude Desktop config:

- **macOS**: `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`
- **Windows**: `%AppData%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "screenpipe-mcp"]
    }
  }
}
```

### Option 2: From Source

Clone and build from source:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/screenpipe/screenpipe
cd screenpipe/crates/screenpipe-integrations/screenpipe-mcp
npm install
npm run build
```

Then configure Claude Desktop:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "screenpipe": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["/absolute/path/to/screenpipe-mcp/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

**Note:** Restart Claude Desktop after making changes.

## Testing

Test with MCP Inspector:

```bash
npx @modelcontextprotocol/inspector npx screenpipe-mcp
```

## Available Tools

### search-content
Search through recorded screen content (OCR) and audio transcriptions:
- Full text search with content type filtering (OCR/Audio/UI)
- Time range and app/window filtering
- Speaker filtering (by ID or name)
- Pagination support

### search-ui-events (macOS)
Search UI input events captured via accessibility APIs. This is the third data modality alongside vision and audio:
- **Event types**: `click`, `text`, `scroll`, `key`, `app_switch`, `window_focus`, `clipboard`
- Filter by app, window, time range
- `text` events show aggregated keyboard input (what was typed)
- `click` events include accessibility element labels
- `clipboard` events show copy/paste content

### get-ui-event-stats (macOS)
Get aggregated statistics of UI events:
- Event counts grouped by app and event type
- Useful for productivity analysis and app usage tracking

### export-video
Export screen recordings as video files:
- Specify time range with start/end times
- Configurable FPS for output video

## Example Queries in Claude

- "Find audio transcriptions from the last hour"
- "Show me what was on my screen in VSCode yesterday"
- "Export a video of my screen from 2-3pm today"
- "Find what John said in our meeting about the database"
- "What did I type in Slack today?" (uses search-ui-events)
- "Show me my app usage statistics for the past 3 hours"
- "What did I copy to clipboard recently?"

## Notes
